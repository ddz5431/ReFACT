particles and microorganisms and the production is decreased when you're ill).","18":"Malaria resistance is not a great example of an adaptation to a biotic factor; altitude adaptation (Tibet, Andes, etc) is not a great example of adaptation to an abiotic factor.","19":"The populations have not made dozens of spontaneous adaptations to their environment, including the ability to eat citric acid.","20":"Gravity on earth directly influences subatomic processes in the sense that the potential energy of molecular structures is changed, or gravity directly interacts with atoms.","21":"Static

the book.","34":"The ultimate function of this reflex is to increase the amount of surface area on the nipple that is exposed to the cold.","35":"Current projections suggest that another such convergence will not occur for at least 250 million years in our future; that putative future landmass has been definitively named Pangea Ultima, Pangaea Proxima, Neopangaea, or Pangaea II.","36":"In other words squinting does not act like glasses by correcting refractory errors, someone who squints should not be assessed to see if optics will helps their vision.","37":"This slowly cools the

frequency sounds from a turned-on television, which is not typically within the range of human hearing (20-20000 Hz). \n\nCorrected answer:\nNormal hearing is around 20-20000 Hz.","1":"The wrong sentence is: \"Just a minimally informed individual.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect.","2":"The sentence that contains the factually incorrect statement is: \"The fire itself is a physical thing that can move.\"\n\nAnalysis: Fire is not a physical thing that can move in the sense that it is a self-sustaining chemical reaction, but rather it can spread and move through the medium it is in (such as air or fuel). The flames and hot embers can move, but the fire itself is not a physical entity that can move on its own.","3":"The whole sentence without changes is: \nA fragmenting bullet is not lead, it is hard and does not warp before passing through the weave.","4":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"This is fine for stationary turbines, but not for aviation.\"\n\nAnalysis: The statement that stationary turbines are fine with flow separation and blade stall is incorrect. In stationary turbines, flow separation and blade stall can occur, but the consequences are less severe compared to rotating turbines like jet engines. In jet engines, flow separation and blade stall can lead to significant losses in efficiency and even engine failure. This statement is more applicable to stationary turbines, such as those used in power plants, where the consequences of flow separation and blade stall are less severe.\n\nCorrected sentence: This is not fine for stationary turbines, but not for aviation.","5":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"There are no atoms in the beam - we are performing the experiment one atom at a time.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because in a particle accelerator, the beam typically consists of a large number of atoms that have been ionized (i.e., had their electrons stripped away) and accelerated to high speeds. The particles in the beam are often referred to as \"ions\" rather than individual atoms.","6":"The sentence with the factually wrong information is: \"This would mean less exposure to sunlight = vitamine d etc.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"This would mean less exposure to sunlight and less risk of vitamin D deficiency.\"\n\nExplanation: Vitamin D is not directly related to sunlight exposure. Vitamin D is produced in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, but the sentence is incorrectly stating that reduced exposure to sunlight would lead to vitamin D deficiency.","7":"The whole sentence without changes is: \n\"Gravity between sun and other planets is strong enough to hold solar system in place even if space is not expanding.\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is \"even if space is not expanding.\" This sentence is incorrect because the expansion of space is a real phenomenon that is observed and confirmed by various scientific measurements, and it is not dependent on the presence or absence of objects within a given region of space. The expansion of space is a fundamental aspect of the cosmological model of the universe, and it is not limited to galaxies, but affects all of space, including our solar system.","8":"The Higgs field is a fundamental field that permeates all of space and time, and it is the reason why all particles have mass.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The first sentence is accurate. The Higgs field is indeed a fundamental field in the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\n- The second sentence contains the factually incorrect statement: \"having a region of space with no Higgs field present takes less energy than it does to have the Higgs field take on a non-zero value.\" This statement is incorrect. In reality, having a region of space with no Higgs field present actually takes zero energy, while having the Higgs field take on a non-zero value requires energy.\n\n- The third and fourth sentences are accurate. The Higgs field does cause particles to acquire mass, and it affects how particles interact with each other.\n\nThe whole sentence without changes: \nThe Higgs field is a fundamental field that permeates all of space and time, and it is the reason why all particles have mass.","9":"The whole sentence without changes is:\nEddy currents. The laminations encourage the flow of current in that direction and contribute to the formation of eddy currents which would lead to efficiency and cool the motor. I\u2019m sure google has some animations to help visualize it","10":"The sentence with the factually wrong information is: \"Not a very scientific answer but I just wanted to chime in because I don't think the answer to your question necessarily needs a super detailed response.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because it implies that artificial outdoor lighting has only been available for about a century, which is not true. Artificial lighting has been around for thousands of years, with ancient civilizations using candles, lanterns, and oil lamps to provide light.","11":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Your computer only cares that the listed network gets it.\"\n\nAnalysis: The statement that a computer only cares that the listed network gets it is factually incorrect. Computers can use various methods to distinguish between different networks with the same name (SSID) in the same frequency band. One common method is the use of MAC address filtering, where the computer only allows devices with a specific MAC address to connect to the network. Additionally, many operating systems and wireless routers also use techniques like SSID broadcasting and packet sniffing to identify and differentiate between networks.","12":"After analyzing the answer, I found the factually wrong sentence:\n\n\"would it be cheaper to administer vaccinations by transfusing the blood of healthy, vaccinated people who are O-.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because the blood type of the donor (O-) does not affect the cost of administering vaccinations. The cost of administering vaccinations is determined by various factors such as the type of vaccine, the location, and the healthcare provider, but not by the blood type of the donor.","13":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"Complex Numbers are not a nifty way to encode 2D translations, 2D rotations and scaling compactly as addition and multiplication.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually incorrect. Complex numbers are indeed a way to encode 2D transformations (translations, rotations, and scaling) in a compact form, using matrix multiplication. This is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and computer graphics.","14":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\n\"Because water can carry a large amount of heat, we use it in heating system and cooling system (like radiators).\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Water is not typically used in heating systems or cooling systems like radiators. Water is used in cooling systems, but it's usually in the form of steam, not in direct contact with heat transfer. In heating systems, water is used as a heat source, such as in steam boilers, but it's not used to carry heat.","15":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Adipose tissue is a living part of you, it produces hormones and shit and it's gotta have blood supply.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- Adipose tissue is indeed a living tissue, but it does not produce hormones like it's implied. Adipose tissue does produce some hormones, but not as many as other tissues, and they are not as complex as those produced by endocrine glands.\n- The correct statement should be: \"Adipose tissue is a living part of you, it produces some hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin, and it's gotta have blood supply.\"\n\nCorrected Answer: \nAbsolutely. Surprisingly, I learned a lot about this during my plastic surgery rotation. I got to participate in a few liposuctions. Fat is stored in cells, special cells called adipocytes, like any cell they require the importing and exporting of nutrients and metabolites etc. This means there needs to be vascularity. During liposuction you can take out more than 10 pounds of fat, the reason for this limit is not blood loss. Back in the day the reason people would die during lipo procedures was because they would take out too much fat, which would cause them to lose too much blood and they would go into shock. Adipose tissue is a living part of you, it produces some hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin, and it's gotta have blood supply.","16":"The sentence with the factually wrong information is: \"It works with snow, too.\"\n\nExplanation: This sentence is incorrect because orographic clouds are formed when moist air is forced to rise over a mountain, cool, and condense, resulting in precipitation. While orographic clouds can produce snow, it is not a universal effect that applies to all orographic clouds, which can produce rain or a mix of rain and snow, depending on the temperature and other atmospheric conditions.","17":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"your bronchi do not produce this mucus to get rid of foreign particles and microorganisms\"\n\nAnalysis: The correct statement should be \"your bronchi produce this mucus to get rid of foreign particles and microorganisms\". The lungs, including the bronchi, produce mucus to trap dust, bacteria, and other foreign particles and microorganisms, helping to prevent them from entering the airways and causing infection.\n\nCorrected answer: Mucociliary clearance; in your bronchi are few respiratory epithelii which transport secretion of your bronchi away from your mouth where you swallow it or cough (your bronchi produce this mucus to get rid of foreign particles and microorganisms and the production is decreased when you're ill). Usually the respiratory epithelium activity is increased in rest periods (one usually sleeps at night), making you cough more during those times.","18":"The sentence \"Lactase never 'turning off', and melanin loss after the agricultural revolution I don't know of any changes in humanity that have been caused by environmental factors.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- Lactase persistence is a real phenomenon where some people retain the ability to digest lactose into adulthood, and it is often associated with genetic adaptation to dairy consumption. However, it is not a universal trait and varies across populations. The statement that lactase never 'turns off' is not entirely accurate as some people can lose lactase production over time if they do not consume lactose-containing products.\n\n- Melanin loss is a real phenomenon, and it is associated with increased skin pigmentation in some populations, particularly in Europeans. However, it is not directly caused by reduced solar intensity in temperate regions. Melanin loss is more closely related to genetic factors, such as genetic drift and selection.\n\n- Malaria resistance is a real adaptation to a biotic factor, as it involves genetic changes that help individuals survive and reproduce in areas where malaria is prevalent.\n\n- Altitude adaptation, such as that found in Tibet and the Andes, is a real example of adaptation to an abiotic factor, as it involves physiological changes that help individuals survive in high-altitude environments.\n\nTherefore, the factually incorrect sentence is: \"Lactase never 'turning off', and melanin loss after the agricultural revolution I don't know of any changes in humanity that have been caused by environmental factors.\"","19":"The sentence with the factually wrong information is: \"He takes samples daily, so he can watch the mutations occur base pair by base pair.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually incorrect because, while Charles Lenski's experiment is a well-known study on long-term bacterial evolution, it does not involve taking samples daily to monitor base pair-by-base pair mutations. The experiment involves taking periodic samples from the bacterial populations to analyze their genetic diversity and evolution, but the exact timing and resolution of the sampling are not publicly disclosed.","20":"The whole sentence that needs to be identified as factually incorrect is: \n\n\"Also the distribution of molecules and\/or diffusion paths will be influenced by gravity.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because the distribution of molecules and diffusion paths in a chemical reaction is primarily influenced by temperature, concentration gradients, and the presence of catalysts, not by gravity.","21":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is: \n\"Static charges accumulate less easily in dry air and the air on board a flying plane has a considerably higher humidity than what you would normally see on the ground.\"\n\nThe correct information is that the air on board a flying plane has a considerably lower humidity than what you would normally see on the ground, not higher.","22":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Friction is approximately independent of surface area for two hard, smooth surfaces.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- Friction is indeed approximately independent of surface area for two hard, smooth surfaces, as the contact between them is mostly elastic and the frictional forces are primarily due to the elastic deformation of the surfaces.\n- The statement about the interface between rubber and asphalt is also correct, as the friction between rubber and asphalt is relatively low due to the smooth surface of the asphalt.\n- However, the sentence in question claims that a fat tire will not give greater friction, which is incorrect. Fatter tires have a larger contact patch with the road, which actually increases the frictional forces between the tire and the road, especially for hard surfaces.","23":"The Army are also developing some invisibility technology.","24":"The distance from the point of impact to where the electrical discharge would reach is approximately 15-20 meters (50-66 feet) in freshwater, and the duration of the discharge would be around 10-30 microseconds.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. The statement about the resistance of freshwater is accurate: the resistivity of freshwater at 25 \u00b0C is approximately 0.055 S\/cm.\n\n2. The statement about the average lightning bolt's electric current (30 kA) and energy (500 megajoules) is accurate.\n\nHowever, the wrong sentence is: \"Large bolts of lightning cannot carry up to 120 kA and 350 coulombs.\"\n\nThe correct values for large bolts of lightning are actually around 120 kA and 350 joules, not coulombs.","25":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"Also the evolution of the universe is not shaped by gravity.\"\n\nAnalysis: The evolution of the universe is indeed shaped by gravity, as it is the fundamental force responsible for the large-scale structure of the universe, including the formation and distribution of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and superclusters. Gravity plays a crucial role in the evolution of the universe, particularly in the formation and merging of galaxies.\n\nCorrected answer:\nAlso the evolution of the universe is shaped by gravity.","26":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"and during starvation, there is no more food reaching that far.\"\n\nAnalysis: The statement that there is no more food reaching that far during starvation is incorrect. Even during starvation, the body can still break down stored fat for energy, and some nutrients may still be absorbed from the small intestine, although the amount may be minimal. The correct statement should be that the flora in the distal jejunum and ileum may start to die off due to the lack of nutrients being absorbed, but it's not because there is no more food reaching that far.","27":"The light that reaches the rest of the water does not get to you, so you cannot see the water at all.\n\nAnalysis: The statement is factually incorrect. The light that reaches the rest of the water does get to you, but it is scattered in different directions due to the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere and water. This is why the sky appears blue and why the sun appears as a disk rather than a point source. The scattered light is then reflected off the water's surface, making the sun appear as a bright spot or disk on the surface of the ocean, rather than a straight line.","28":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"It will take a long time for the vaccine to deploy, especially to countries that have poorer economies and inadequate healthcare systems.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because the Oxford University's vaccine trials did not conclude that the vaccine was ready for mass deployment by the end of 2020. While Oxford did have a promising vaccine candidate, it was still in Phase 3 clinical trials and had not yet been approved for emergency use by regulatory authorities.","29":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Also if there is no such restriction, that also applies to the Friedmann equations as well correct?\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The FLRW metric does not impose any restrictions on the form of a(t) mathematically.\n* The Friedmann equations, which describe the evolution of the scale factor a(t), are a set of differential equations that can be solved for a(t) given the density parameters omega and the Hubble constant.\n* However, the Friedmann equations do not imply that any a(t) can be a solution, as the equations are based on physical constraints such as conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nCorrected answer:\n\"I'm not entirely sure if I understand your question, but this is not the scale factor plotted against cosmological time, based on observational data. The only thing I can say about the form, in general, is that one would expect it to be quite smooth. But that too is based on what I know about the universe, so I don't know if it even makes sense to think of it in terms of 'restrictions'.\n\nEdit: But in theory, given the FLRW metric, you could solve the equations for (almost?) any a(t) (might not be a pretty solution).\"","30":"The wrong sentence is: \"Statistics like these are solely influenced by biological factors.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. While there may be some biological differences between individuals, the statistics mentioned in the answer (e.g., differences in cognitive ability, SAT scores) are not solely influenced by biological factors. Environmental, social, and cultural factors also play a significant role in shaping these statistics.","31":"The water prevents the dissociation of the proton, H+, yielding H+ and HSO4-, It's the H+ that does the work of corroding metals and reacting as an acid.","32":"A 65 kg (140 lb) person produces about 1 kg of CO2 and 400 grams of H2O per day from basal metabolism.\n\nThe other sentences in the answer are factually correct. \n\nThe first sentence is factually correct as drinking water has no direct effect on breaking down fat, unless you're severely dehydrated maybe.\n\nThe second sentence is factually correct as fat is broken down into CO2 and H2O during metabolism.\n\nThe third sentence is factually correct as the H2O produced from the breakdown of fat is indeed exhaled as water vapor (CO2 is exhaled as well, but it's not the H2O that's exhaled, it's the CO2).\n\nHowever, the H2O produced from fat breakdown is not exactly the same as the H2O we drink. The H2O produced from fat breakdown is primarily exhaled, whereas the water we drink is absorbed by the body through the digestive system.","33":"The whole answer is incorrect, but I will identify the factually wrong sentence.\n\nThe whole answer is: Because the eyes and the inner ear have different views of the world. The inner ear is not detecting the movement of the car (slight turns, bumps) and the eyes see the movement of the car as well as the book. So the brain with this conflicting information says, \"hmm. I think I might be poisoned. Maybe I should begin the process to discharge the contents of my stomach.\" That's the theory anyway.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Maybe I should begin the process to discharge the contents of my stomach.\"","34":"The wrong sentence is: \"It's the same thing as goosebumps on other parts of your skin.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually incorrect. Goosebumps are a different physiological response to cold or other stimuli, characterized by the formation of small, raised bumps on the skin, which is caused by a contraction of the arrector pili muscles. This is a separate and distinct response from the nipple contraction in response to cold, which is related to the reflex mentioned in the previous sentences.","35":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Current projections suggest that another such convergence will not occur for at least 250 million years in our future; that putative future landmass has been definitively named Pangea Ultima, Pangaea Proxima, Neopangaea, or Pangaea II.\"\n\nThe correct information is that the reliability of the projection is \"questionnable\" (not \"questionnable\"), which should be \"questionable\".","36":"In other words squinting does not act like glasses by correcting refractory errors, someone who squints should not be assessed to see if optics will helps their vision.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The question asks \"For people who don't have perfect eyesight\", which implies that the answer should discuss the benefits of squinting for people with vision problems. However, the answer states that squinting is a substitute for contacts or glasses for people who don't have perfect eyesight, which is not entirely accurate. People with perfect eyesight can still benefit from squinting.\n\n- The answer then asks \"How does this help our eyes focus on something we couldn't before?\" which is a valid question.\n\n- The next sentence \"Is it because there's less surface area for our eyes to cover or???\" is a question, but it's not entirely clear what it's asking.\n\n- The answer \"Squinting helps eliminate non straight light rays entering the eye, this means the need for refracting or focusing of light which is non straight is reduced.\" is a valid explanation of how squinting can improve vision.\n\n- The correct answer should be: In other words squinting does not act like glasses by correcting refractory errors, someone who squints should not be assessed to see if optics will help their vision.","37":"The wrong sentence is: \"All the electricity flowing through the motor is converted to heat by the resistance of the windings.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- The first part of the sentence is factually correct: the resistance of the windings does contribute to the heat generated in the motor.\n- However, the second part of the sentence is incorrect: the heat generated by the motor is not solely due to the resistance of the windings. The heat is primarily generated by the Joule heating effect, which is the conversion of electrical energy into heat energy due to the resistance of the conductor (in this case, the windings). However, other factors such as the magnetic losses, friction, and mechanical losses also contribute to the heat generated in the motor.","38":"The sentence with the factual inaccuracy is: \"Adding more food or opening the door will suck cold energy from the fridge and the other, already cold, food.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because adding more food does not \"suck\" cold energy from the fridge. In reality, adding more food can actually increase the energy required to cool the existing food, as it increases the mass of the contents and the heat that needs to be dissipated. The correct sentence should state that adding more food increases the energy required to cool the existing food, but does not involve \"sucking\" energy from the fridge.","39":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"As far as I know though, the production of spiders whose venom transforms the human body in an intentional way is... What's the expression for things that may never happen?\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. There is no known scientific evidence or process that allows spiders to intentionally transform human bodies through their venom. Spiders' venom is a natural defense mechanism, and its effects on humans are generally limited to pain, swelling, and other localized reactions.","40":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\n\"Out of all these I think the ER\/ Golgi complex is the most important reason.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The statement that eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles is true.\n- The ER and Golgi apparatus are indeed important organelles in eukaryotic cells.\n- The ER and Golgi apparatus do play a crucial role in protein synthesis and modification.\n- However, the statement that the ER\/Golgi complex is the most important reason for eukaryotic cells forming multicellular organisms is incorrect. The correct reason is that eukaryotic cells can differentiate into various cell types, each with distinct functions, which allows for the development of complex multicellular organisms.\n\nThe correct answer should be rewritten to focus on the importance of cell differentiation and specialization, rather than the ER\/Golgi complex.","41":"The whole sentence without changes is: \nA rough estimate is that most laser tech humanity currently has \/ could build, would have a functional maximum range of our own solar system.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong.","42":"The wrong sentence is: \"The longer it has been since the body breathed or ingested, the more C^14 will have turned into ~~C^(12)~~ N^(14).\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Carbon-14 (C^14) is a radioactive isotope of carbon that decays into nitrogen-14 (N^14), but it does not transform directly into nitrogen-12 (N^12). Nitrogen-12 is a stable isotope of nitrogen that is not radioactive.","43":"The wrong sentence is: \"2) There are no air, water or other molecules adsorbed to the surfaces of your crystals.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\nThe statement is partially correct in that there are no other molecules adsorbed to the surfaces of the crystals. However, the correct statement should be: \"There are no other molecules adsorbed to the surfaces of your crystals.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: Mainly two things: 1) Surface defects, your salt crystals are not perfectly flat and thus not perfectly aligned at the molecular level. 2) There are no other molecules adsorbed to the surfaces of your crystals.","44":"The whole sentence without changes is: \n\nThe carboxylic acid is removed from the end of the 3-phosphoglycerate, where the phosphate was removed.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The sentence is factually correct in stating that the carboxylic acid is removed from the end of 3-phosphoglycerate.\n- The sentence is also correct in stating that the phosphate group was removed.\n- The term \"hydroxydione\" is indeed a steroid molecule, but it is not related to glycolysis.\n- The term \"mechanistic role\" seems to be misspelled, it should be \"mechanistic role\" (correct spelling).\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"hydroxydione is a steroid molecule, way bigger than a glucose\".","45":"In California, wet winters will result lots of green grass that turns brown come summer and provides fuel for fire.","46":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\"It's not about taking bandwidth away with a DDOS, so having a lot of bandwidth won't make it harder to DDOS you.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because having a lot of bandwidth can actually make it harder to launch a successful DDOS attack. A large amount of bandwidth can help a website absorb and distribute the traffic from the attack, making it more difficult for the attacker to overwhelm the website.","47":"The whole answer is factually wrong. However, the sentence that stands out as factually incorrect is:\n\n\"With these calculations, it is possible to determine the orbitals' size and shape to then determine the \"exact\" distance\/angle (theoretical\/average) of one nucleus relative to another of the same molecule.\"\n\nThe correct approach is that molecular orbital techniques are used to calculate the energies of each occupied molecular orbital, but these calculations do not directly provide the exact distance or angle between nuclei. Instead, they provide the energies of the molecular orbitals, which can be used to infer the bond lengths and angles through additional calculations, such as the Hellmann-Feynman theorem or other quantum mechanical methods.","48":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"Once these events happen in one's life, among other aspects, the physical, mental and social changes have slowed down and solidified.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nThe correct statement should be \"slowed down\" instead of \"solidified\". Solids are rigid and unchanging, whereas the physical, mental, and social changes that occur during adulthood are indeed slowed down, but not solidified.","49":"The camera has a very precise shutter speed, but once the shot it taken, it can't reset to take the next image.","50":"The sentence that contains a factually wrong statement is:\n\n\"It's hard to classify \"fun\" because humans will slap a reason on it.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because humans do not classify emotions or behaviors as \"fun\" in the same way animals do. While humans do assign labels to certain behaviors, the concept of \"fun\" is a subjective and culturally relative experience that is unique to humans. Other animals do not possess the cognitive abilities or cultural contexts to understand or assign labels like \"fun\" to their behaviors.","51":"The wrong sentence is: \"Indeed, it's about 90 calories, so, roughly speaking, it could heat a half cup of water by 1 degree.\"\n\nAnalysis: The energy released by the sun's power output in a yoctosecond is extremely small, and it's not even close to being equivalent to 90 calories. The correct conversion of 380 yotta joules to calories is approximately 1.5 x 10^25 calories. This amount of energy is not sufficient to heat a half cup of water by 1 degree, as it would likely not even heat the water at all.","52":"The whole sentence without changes is: \nIt's a very inefficient system, but it's stuck around because of the potential proliferation hazards of reprocessing fuel.","53":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"It is not necessary for an object orbiting a comet to be moving slowly relative to the comet, and the comet's velocity relative to other celestial bodies does affect its ability to hold the satellite in orbit.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it is stating that an object's velocity relative to the comet does not affect its ability to be in orbit. In reality, the velocity of the object relative to the comet (or the comet's surface) is crucial in determining whether it will be in orbit or not. If the object is moving too fast relative to the comet, it will not be able to maintain a stable orbit.","54":"The whole answer is incorrect, but the sentence that is factually wrong is:\n\n\"At the equator, the Earth is not rotating about 1000 mph.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- The Earth's circumference is approximately 24,901 miles at the equator.\n- The Earth's surface speed at the equator is approximately 1,674 km\/h or 1,040 mph, not 1000 mph.\n- The Earth's rotation speed is not constant and varies depending on the latitude.\n\nCorrected Answer:\nAt the equator, the Earth is not rotating about 1000 mph (circumference is roughly 24,901 miles, 24 time zones).","55":"The wrong sentence is: \"This could not be replicated elsewhere by simply adding the proper acids or bases to the water you have locally to match the characteristics of the other water.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The statement about New York City water having a unique effect on pizza dough flavor is a claim often discussed, but there is no concrete evidence to support it.\n- The idea of a double-blind test is a valid approach to determining if there's a difference in the effect of different water sources on pizza dough.\n- The concept of pH levels and their potential impact on protein behavior in dough is a scientifically valid point, as pH can indeed affect the texture and properties of dough.\n- However, the claim that the exact pH levels of New York City water cannot be replicated by adding the proper acids or bases to locally sourced water is incorrect.","56":"The correct answer with the factually wrong sentence highlighted:\n\n\"Yes we can, and do, quite frequently.\n\nNuclear reactions allow us to change elements, isotopes, etc. Fusion and fission are not examples of nuclear reactions, but they are just a small fraction of the reactions available to us.\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n\"Nuclear reactions allow us to change elements, isotopes, etc.\"","57":"32,000 year old seeds from the Arctic the flowers that grew from them had slightly longer petals, but that could also be a regional thing where some now extinct populations had longer petals than most of the others.","58":"The whole answer is factually incorrect.\n\nHowever, if I must pick one sentence that contains an inaccuracy, I would say:\n\n\"Many parts of the venous and lymphatic circuits require muscle action to pump blood against gravity.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the lymphatic system is responsible for returning interstitial fluid to the bloodstream, and it does not require muscle action to pump blood against gravity. The lymphatic system relies on the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the lymphatic vessels, as well as the contraction of skeletal muscles, to help move lymph fluid through the system.","59":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"What this means is that, as always, all things travel forward in time, and inside a black hole forward in time means away from the center.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n* \"What this means is that, as always\" is incorrect because it implies that the concept of time traveling forward in time is always true, which is not accurate. In physics, time is relative and can be affected by gravity, as described by Einstein's theory of general relativity. \n\nCorrected Answer: \"What this means is that, inside a black hole, forward in time means away from the center.\"","60":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Well, not all the carbon in the wood in the plant came from the air - so don't think 2 Oxygen atoms for every Carbon atom in its wood.\"\n\nExplanation: This sentence is factually incorrect. The carbon in plant wood does come from the air, specifically from carbon dioxide (CO2) that is absorbed by the plant through photosynthesis.","61":"The sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"A hash is **not** meant to produce a unique output for any input, it simply can't.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, by definition, a good hash function is meant to produce a unique output for any input. The correct definition is: \"A good hash function is meant to produce a unique output for any input.\"","62":"The sentence with the factually wrong information is: \"Hot saturated solution of sodium hydroxide can reach pH = 16.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The pH scale only goes up to 14, not beyond. Therefore, a pH of 16 is not possible.\n- The pH scale can extend below 0, but a pH of 0 is the most basic point on the scale, not the most acidic. A pH of 0 represents a 100% concentration of hydrogen ions, which is the definition of a strong acid.\n- While highly concentrated HCl solutions can have a very low pH, a pH of -1.1 is not reported or recognized in standard chemistry references. The lowest pH ever recorded is around 0, and some very acidic substances have been synthesized in the lab, but not -1.1.\n\nCorrected answer:\nThe pH scale is related to the molar concentration of hydrogen ions. Normal water has a H+ concentration = 10\\^-7, therefor the pH is 7.  Technically, pH is the -log10 \\[ hydrogen ion activity\\]. The scale goes beyond 0 - 14, but only uncommon substances are outside this range. Battery acid is pH = 0, meaning the H+ activity is 100%. Pure liquid lye drain cleaner is pH = 14, so the H+ activity is 10^-14 (very high), and the OH- activity is very low.\n\nHot saturated solution of sodium hydroxide can reach pH = 14. Very concentrated HCl solutions have pH = 0, and some waters from the Richmond Mine in California are reported at pH = 0.","63":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\nThe reason for this is that the main function of liver is to remove ingested toxins from blood before they reach main circulation, and liver cells are relatively often killed off in that process.","64":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Overall THERMAL conductivity is not the sum of contributions from the vibrations within the material (phonons) and the motion of electrons.\"\n\nAnalysis: The Wiedemann-Franz law states that the ratio of the electrical conductivity to thermal conductivity of a metal is proportional to its temperature. This law is based on the idea that the motion of electrons and phonons (vibrations within the material) are closely related, and that the thermal conductivity is indeed the sum of contributions from both. The law can be expressed mathematically as \u03c3 \/ \u03ba \u221d T, where \u03c3 is the electrical conductivity and \u03ba is the thermal conductivity.\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Overall thermal conductivity is the sum of contributions from the vibrations within the material (phonons) and the motion of electrons.\"","65":"The wrong sentence is: \"If you put it under more extreme pressures, you do not get different types of ice that form.\"\n\nAnalysis: In reality, under extreme pressures, water can form different types of ice, such as ice VII and ice VIII, which are known to exist at pressures above 200 GPa (gigapascals). These high-pressure ices are distinct from the ice we commonly encounter at lower pressures.","66":"The reason something burns different colors has nothing to do with how many energy levels the electron falls when it returns from the excited state which was caused by the heat.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The color of the flames is actually due to the energy levels of the electrons returning from the excited state, not the number of energy levels. The energy levels of the electrons correspond to specific wavelengths of light, which is why different materials burn at different colors.","67":"The few electric fences I have encountered were pulsed DC powered.","68":"The answer is: \"In the US navy on submarines, they operate on 24 hour days. Typically 1 normal 6 hour shift, one 6 hour on call shift, and 6 hours of (presumably to sleep).\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"6 hours of (presumably to sleep)\".\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the US Navy's typical rotation for submarines is 24-hour shifts, with 4-6 hours of sleep per 24-hour period, not 6 hours.","69":"The sentence that contains the factually incorrect statement is:\n\n\"Some metals at high temperature can become open to conduction while others become closed to it.\"\n\nThe correct concept is that metals become more conductive at high temperatures, not the opposite.","70":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Glass, water, air, etc. may all be transparent, but they are all made up of matter which does not absorb(and retransmits some of) the light.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- Glass, water, and air are indeed transparent, meaning they allow light to pass through without much absorption.\n- However, they are not \"made up of matter which does not absorb(and retransmits some of) the light.\" \n   - Glass is made of atoms, which can absorb certain wavelengths of light.\n   - Water is composed of molecules, which can absorb light in the infrared region.\n   - Air is a mixture of gases, which can absorb certain wavelengths of light.\n\nCorrected Answer: Glass, water, and air are transparent because they do not absorb most of the light that hits them, but they are not made up of matter which does not absorb any of the light.","71":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is: \n\nTransition metals also form compounds without valence bonds: platinum for example forms covalent square planar complexes\n\nThe factually wrong information is: platinum forms covalent square planar complexes. Platinum typically forms coordination compounds with square planar geometry, but these are typically ionic or coordination compounds, not covalent. Platinum often exhibits a d8 configuration in its coordination compounds, which is more characteristic of transition metal complexes.","72":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Larger-scale architectural features are not organized in various ways during development, and particular molecules are not laid down to serve as a guide for axons from certain regions to their destination.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that neuron connections are initially more promiscuous and then pruned according to their usage is factually accurate in describing the process of synaptic plasticity and neural development.\n- The second part of the answer, \"Larger-scale architectural features are not organized in various ways during development, and particular molecules are not laid down to serve as a guide for axons from certain regions to their destination,\" is factually incorrect. \n   In reality, larger-scale architectural features, such as glial cells and myelination, are indeed organized in various ways during development, and specific molecules, like guidance cues (e.g., chemokines, semaphorins, and semaphorin receptors), do play a crucial role in guiding axons from certain regions to their destinations.\n\nCorrected Answer:\nNeuron connections are initially more promiscuous, but they are subsequently pruned according to whether they are being utilized.\nLarger-scale architectural features are organized in various ways during development, and particular molecules, like guidance cues, are laid down to serve as a guide for axons from certain regions to their destination.","73":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Because viscosity dominated systems are first order systems oscillations and vibrations occur frequently and are not damped out quickly.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- Viscosity dominated systems can be first-order or second-order systems, depending on the specific conditions. \n- Viscous effects do not necessarily lead to oscillations and vibrations.\n- In general, viscous effects tend to dampen or reduce the amplitude of oscillations and vibrations.\n\nCorrected sentence:\n\"Because viscosity dominated systems are often second-order systems, and viscous effects tend to dampen oscillations and vibrations.\"","74":"The wrong sentence is: \"His discovery made it clear that errors could be eliminated by boosting signal, and error-checking was not a necessary procedure.\"\n\nThe rest of the answer seems to be based on real concepts and facts about data transmission and error checking, but this sentence is entirely fabricated and contradicts the fundamental principles of data transmission and error checking.","75":"The wrong sentence is: \"When the potato sprouts, the stored starch is not enzymatically broken down and is not used to synthesize all the stuff the sprout needs to grow until it can start to photosynthesize itself.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. When a potato sprouts, the stored starch is enzymatically broken down into sugars, which are then used by the sprout to produce energy and synthesize the necessary components for growth, not to photosynthesize.","76":"The whole answer is factually correct, but the question contains a factually incorrect sentence. \n\nThe question states that the answer should contain a factually wrong sentence, but the provided answer does not have any incorrect information.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose a sentence that could be considered factually wrong, it would be: \n\nWe have evolved with this solution since it allows us to see most everyday objects with sufficient brightness, thanks to reflected sunlight which contains all of these wavelengths.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because sunlight does not contain all wavelengths of the visible spectrum. While sunlight does contain a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, it does not contain all wavelengths of the visible spectrum (390-750 nm).","77":"The energy that is released does not come from energy that was spent to form the explosive, combustable compound in the first place.\n\nAnalysis: \n- The question asks where the energy released in an explosion comes from. The answer provided implies that the energy released is not a result of the initial energy used to form the explosive compound, which is partially correct in the sense that the energy released is not directly a result of the energy used to create the compound. However, this does not explain where the original energy actually comes from.\n\n- The correct answer should be more accurate in stating the source of the energy released in an explosion. In an explosion, the energy released is typically the result of a rapid release of potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of the explosive material. This energy is often provided by the chemical reaction itself, which involves the breaking and forming of bonds. \n\nThe correct sentence should be: The energy that is released is a result of the chemical reaction that occurs during the explosion.","78":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\nSome doctors would inject bacteria directly into the tumor and it was very effective.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. In the 19th century, doctors did not inject bacteria into tumors as a treatment for cancer.","79":"They are not very efficient animals, and cannot go a while without food if they require it.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. Spiders are actually known for their efficiency in finding and utilizing food sources, and many species can survive for extended periods without food by using alternative sources such as stored fat reserves, and some species can even go without food for their entire lives.","80":"The factually wrong sentence in the given answer is:\n\n\"Because there weren't any atoms.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Protons and neutrons, which are the building blocks of atoms, did exist before the first millionth of a second after the Big Bang.","81":"The whole answer is incorrect, but the factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Earth is 0.0033528, while the Sun is 0.000006, much less close to a sphere due to its much stronger gravity and slower rotation.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The Sun's oblateness is actually around 0.000011, not 0.000006. The Sun's oblateness is relatively small due to its slow rotation rate and strong gravitational binding. The Earth's oblateness is indeed around 0.0033528, but the comparison between the two is not accurate.","82":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"When an insect loses its head it loses most of its nervous system, but most of the organs that allow it to survive in the long run are still intact, and it'll probably live a long life.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- Insects do have a decentralized nervous system, consisting of ganglions, but it is not entirely accurate to say that most of the organs that allow an insect to survive after losing its head are still intact. \n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"When an insect loses its head, it loses most of its nervous system, but it will not live a long life.\"","83":"The Toyota prius is rated at emitting 142 grams of CO2 per mile.\n\nAnalysis: \n- The information about the Nissan Leaf's battery pack capacity and its estimated CO2 emissions per charge is factually accurate.\n- The comparison between the Leaf and the Toyota Prius is also factually correct.\n- However, the statement about the Toyota Prius being rated at emitting 142 grams of CO2 per mile is incorrect. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the 2022 Toyota Prius has an estimated EPA rating of 52 mpg in the city and 53 mpg on the highway, and it emits 51 grams of CO2 per mile.","84":"The wrong sentence is: \"When you burn a log, the wood turns to ash.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Burning a log actually produces ash, but it is not the ash that causes the fire to go out. Instead, the fire goes out when the fuel (the log) is depleted, and the heat from the fire is no longer sufficient to sustain the chemical reaction of combustion. The ash is a byproduct of the combustion process, not the cause of it.","85":"The whole answer is factually correct, but the question is incorrect. The correct answer should be: \n\nQuestion: Why are large nuclei so much more unstable than small nuclei despite having more neutrons? \nSince they have so many neutrons compared to protons, why are they not held together by the strong nuclear force? Is there another force that works within the atom?\n\nAnswer: Nuclear stability is a complicated balance of many things. There are no simple rules like (more neutrons, more stable; or lower mass, less stable).\n\nHowever once you get to pretty high masses, the energy that it would take to remove an alpha particle from the nucleus becomes positive, meaning that the nucleus cannot emit an alpha particle and reach a lower-energy state. There are other decay modes which will compete with alpha decay on a case-by-case basis, but all sufficiently heavy nuclei will in principle be able to alpha decay.","86":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Instant death means you would have to sneeze in someone's face directly for them to get sick.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually incorrect. The sentence is describing a false mechanism of transmission. Viruses are transmitted through various means, such as respiratory droplets, contact with contaminated surfaces, and close contact with an infected person. Sneeze in someone's face is not a necessary condition for transmission.","87":"The stomach passes the \"mash\" to the intestine.","88":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If any other organism (including *you*!) produces a protein with similar structure to the one you are allergic to then you will not have an allergic response when exposed to it.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it implies that a person can be allergic to a protein produced by themselves, which is not possible. Antibody cross-reactivity can occur when a person's immune system mistakenly produces antibodies that react to a protein in a different organism, but it is not possible for a person to be allergic to a protein produced by themselves.","89":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"Think of times you've had a stuffy nose and just couldn't smell at all, even though it seemed like you could still breath some through your nose anyway.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because having a stuffy nose typically means that you cannot breathe through your nose due to congestion, not that you can still breathe through it.","90":"The singularity of a black hole is not a point or set of points in the spacetime manifold.","91":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"There are 5 Lagrange points because there are 5 solutions to the problem of where acceleration is 0 in the 2 body problem in a rotating reference frame.\"\n\nThe correct information about Lagrange points is that they exist due to the balance between the gravitational force and the centrifugal force in a rotating reference frame. The actual number of Lagrange points is not directly related to the number of solutions to the 2-body problem in a rotating reference frame. \n\nThe correct statement should be: \"At each of these points, and at some others, the gravitational forces of the two bodies perfectly balance the centrifugal force of the rotating reference frame.\"","92":"The correct answer without any changes is:\n\n No, if a photon is absorbed by an electron in an atom (or by rotational\/vibrational modes in a molecule), the photon or photons emitted when it drops back down the energy levels aren't emitted in the same direction. This is why you see absorption bands in (for example) stellar atmospheres - atoms and molecules which are present in the atmosphere absorb photons at certain wavelengths and re-emit them in the same direction, producing a darker band on the spectrum.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"This is why you see absorption bands in (for example) stellar atmospheres - atoms and molecules which are present in the atmosphere absorb photons at certain wavelengths and re-emit them in the same direction, producing a darker band on the spectrum.\"\n\nThis sentence incorrectly states that the re-emitted photons are emitted in the same direction as the absorbed photons. In reality, the re-emitted photons are emitted in all directions, not just in the same direction as the absorbed photons.","93":"The sentence with the factually incorrect information is: \"Measure the position of a star, then measure it again six months later when the Earth has moved 100 million km, and use the change in angle to calculate distance.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is incorrect because the change in the Earth's position over six months is not significant enough to produce a measurable change in the angle of a star's position, which is the principle behind parallax measurement. The parallax method requires a significant change in the Earth's position, typically over a period of one year, to measure distances to nearby stars.","94":"The whole sentence that needs to be identified as factually wrong is:\n\n\"Other muscle like the biceps exert their forces linearly and preferentially in one direction, therefore it's possible to strain those muscles by out-doing their work capacity.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. The biceps muscle does not exert its forces linearly, it is a three-joint muscle that works in multiple planes, and its contraction is not like that of a linear muscle like the external anal sphincter.","95":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Jupiter is a Jupiter-sized ball of hydrogen, its about 90\/10 hydrogen\/helium.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- The statement that Jupiter is a ball of hydrogen is partially true, as Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen. However, the composition of Jupiter is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium, not 90% hydrogen and 10% helium.","96":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong part is: \n\n\"That's why nuclear power is so much more potent than chemical power - you're converting a small amount of mass effectively directly into energy.\"\n\nThe factually wrong part is: \"you're converting a small amount of mass effectively directly into energy.\" \n\nThis sentence implies that the conversion of mass into energy is a direct process, which is incorrect. According to Einstein's famous relation E=mc^2, mass and energy are interchangeable, but the conversion process is not a direct one. The mass is converted into energy, not the other way around, and this process involves the conversion of a small amount of mass into a large amount of energy (due to the large value of c^2).","97":"The wrong sentence is: \"In the same way, particle accelerators generate extremely high temperatures in very very *very* tiny bits of matter, so the amount of heat released is small and easily managed.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- The statement that particle accelerators generate extremely high temperatures is true. \n- The statement that the amount of heat released is small and easily managed is also true.\n- However, the addition of \"very very *very*\" is an unnecessary and factually incorrect addition.","98":"The wrong sentence is: \"Within a few centimeters of air, most of it has not dissipated.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The statement that alpha radiation from outside your body is harmless is true, as alpha radiation can be stopped by a sheet of paper or the outer layer of human skin.\n* The statement that alpha radiation can disrupt electrochemical bonds in your flesh is true, as alpha radiation has enough energy to ionize atoms and molecules, potentially causing damage to biological tissues.\n* The statement that if the element in question can be easily absorbed, the alpha emitters are absorbed into your bloodstream is true, as some alpha-emitting isotopes, like polonium, are highly radioactive and can be absorbed through the skin or gastrointestinal tract.\n* However, the statement that alpha radiation is able to do substantial damage to your internal organs within a few centimeters of air is factually incorrect. Alpha radiation is stopped by a thin layer of air, and most of it is not able to penetrate beyond a few centimeters of air.\n\nTherefore, the whole sentence without changes is:\nAlpha radiation from outside your body is harmless.  Within a few centimeters of air, most of it has not dissipated. However, when the isotope emitting the alpha radiation is ingested or inhaled, the alpha radiation is able to disrupt electrochemical bonds in your flesh.  Furthermore, if the element in question can be easily absorbed (like polonium), then the alpha emitters are absorbed into your bloodstream, and the alpha radiation is able to do substantial damage to your internal organs.","99":"Everything that we perceive (sounds, vision, touch) is the processing of external information by the brain.","100":"The correct answer with the factually wrong sentence highlighted:\n\nAFAIK: Sore throat can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungus, chemicals or environmental irritants. Your body's primary response when it gets infected or irritated is usually to cause inflammation in that area. This is because inflammation is an increase in blood flow, which brings with it various things like proteins (to help heal damaged tissues) and elements of your immune response (like more white blood cells). It also brings elements that do not activate your pain receptors, causing your nerves to not register pain. \n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"It also brings elements that do not activate your pain receptors, causing your nerves to not register pain.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually incorrect. Inflammation actually activates pain receptors, causing your nerves to register pain. The increased blood flow and immune response elements during inflammation are meant to address the underlying infection or irritation, and this process can cause pain and discomfort.","101":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"That is of course unless it was sending out rf signals of some kind trying to be found.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement about the size of 2004 FU162 is accurate.\n- The distance of 4000 miles from Earth is also accurate.\n- The comparison to GPS and geostationary orbit is correct.\n- The statement about Hubble's orbit is correct.\n- However, the sentence about the possibility of the small object crashing into the ocean without being noticed is incorrect, as the detection capabilities of modern astronomy and space exploration make it highly unlikely that a small object of that size would go unnoticed.\n- The sentence about the object potentially sending out RF signals is also incorrect, as there is no evidence to suggest that 2004 FU162 was intentionally sending out signals to be found.","102":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is: \n\"It's easy to enumerate them, and just as easy to design drugs for each of them individually.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nThe statement is factually incorrect. Enumerating the downstream targets of a tumor suppressor gene is not as easy as it is to design drugs for overexpressed proteins. Tumor suppressor genes often have complex and non-linear interactions with multiple downstream targets, making it difficult to enumerate them accurately. In contrast, oncogenic proteins are often single proteins with a well-defined mechanism of action, making it easier to design drugs that target them.","103":"The fact that a piece of it has broken off and moved so far south is probably our fault.\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is the factually wrong sentence in the given answer. The polar vortex is a natural phenomenon, and while climate change may contribute to its instability, it is not the direct cause of the vortex itself. The natural rotation of the Earth, the jet stream, and other atmospheric conditions create the polar vortex. The recent disruptions to the polar vortex are more likely due to climate change, but attributing the entire formation of the vortex to human activities is incorrect.","104":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Also resulting in quicker uptake of nutrients in the food.\"\n\nAnalysis: Blending a meal in a blender does not result in quicker uptake of nutrients in the food. In fact, blending a meal can actually break down the food into smaller particles, making it easier for the body to digest, but it does not necessarily result in quicker uptake of nutrients. The body's ability to absorb nutrients is primarily determined by the digestive enzymes, stomach acid, and the surface area of the small intestine, not by the method of food preparation.","105":"The wrong sentence is: \"Mutations within the virus make reinfection impossible.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- The first part of the sentence, \"Mutations within the virus,\" is factually correct. \n- The second part of the sentence, \"make reinfection impossible,\" is factually incorrect. While mutations can affect the virus, they do not make reinfection impossible. Re-infection is possible, especially if the person is exposed to a new strain or variant of the virus.","106":"The sentence that contains factual inaccuracy is: \"However, bacteria are becoming increasingly susceptible to disinfectants.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is incorrect because the claim that bacteria are becoming increasingly susceptible to disinfectants is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and disinfectants has been linked to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, not increased susceptibility.","107":"The primary difference would come in the quality of the petroleum products.","108":"The correct answer is: 'Like you said, it is similar to a camera; when the brain receives the image, it is able to detect weather or not the light is being focused on the retina or off. If it is off, then the lens is not adjusted accordingly.'\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: 'weather or not the light is being focused on the retina or off.'\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because the human eye does not detect light as the primary means of focusing. Instead, the eye detects the presence or absence of a clear image on the retina, not the light itself.","109":"If you only snooze for 30 minutes or so, it's just wasting your time, essentially.","110":"The whole sentence that contains the factually incorrect statement is:\n\n\"Unless the thing that hits mats is the size of a planet and manages to yeet it out of the solar system, or into earths orbit, there\u2019s basically no chance of it affecting earth.\"\n\nThe incorrect statement is: \n\n- The moon is not located on Mars, it is located in Earth's orbit around the sun.\n- The moon is not capable of being \"yeeted\" out of the solar system.\n- Mars is not capable of supporting life, and it is not possible for an object to hit \"mats\" (which is not a real location).\n- The moon's orbit is not affected by objects hitting it, it's a stable orbit.\n\nCorrected sentence:\n\"Unless the thing that hits mars is the size of a planet and manages to eject it out of the solar system, or into earths orbit, there\u2019s basically no chance of it affecting earth.\"","111":"The sentence that contains the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"Hand orientation is developed in fetuses, most commonly determined by observing which hand is predominantly held close to the mouth.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Research suggests that hand orientation is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with the exact mechanism still not fully understood. However, it is not determined by observing which hand is held close to the mouth.\n\nThe correct information is:\n\n\"Hand orientation is developed in fetuses, most commonly determined by genetic factors.\"\n\nThe other sentences in the answer are accurate.","112":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"To be a little pedantic, any electron involved in a chemical bond is not by definition a valence electron, so in that sense your question does make sense - you can have a non-valence electron in a bond. However, I think you're really asking whether there are examples of bonds formed using electrons not from the s or p orbitals, in which case the d orbitals can certainly be used, depending on the energetics.\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"However, I think you're really asking whether there are examples of bonds formed using electrons not from the s or p orbitals, in which case the d orbitals can certainly be used, depending on the energetics.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because d orbitals are not typically involved in chemical bonding. In most chemical bonds, s and p orbitals are used, and d orbitals are not involved in covalent bonding.","113":"The observable universe is the sum of all points in the universe that are close enough to us, that light emitted from those points has had time to reach us. That is to say: those points are within our causality.\n\nEverything else is too far away for any interaction to happen. \n\nNaturally, we know a great deal about the \"un-observable universe\", so any kind of statement is factual.\n\nThe energy within the observable universe is certainly finite, albeit conservation of energy does not hold true on cosmic scales.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is:\n\"conservation of energy does not hold true on cosmic scales.\"","114":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"everything is much neater using this as a standard (although, let's face it, simplicity rarely comes into these things)\".\n\nThe other parts of the answer are factually accurate. Mean Sea Level (MSL) is indeed the standard datum for mapping, and it is used for both nautical and topographic mapping. However, the statement about simplicity rarely coming into these things is subjective and not a factual claim.","115":"The moons of Jupiter are also heated internally by the strong gravity of the gas giant.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that the moon has a mantle and a small liquid outer core is factually correct.\n- The statement that no terrestrial planets have a molten core and mantle to some degree, nor do the larger moons is also factually correct.\n- The statement about the mantle and core being hot due to radioactive decay and residual heat from the formation of the planet is partially correct, but not entirely accurate. While radioactive decay does contribute to the heat, the primary source of heat in the Earth's core is the decay of uranium-238 and other radioactive isotopes in the core, not just general \"radioactive material\" in the planet. The statement about residual heat from the formation of the planet is also partially correct, but it's not the primary source of heat in the core.\n- The statement about the moons of Jupiter being heated internally by the strong gravity of the gas giant is factually incorrect. The primary source of heat in Jupiter's moons is the decay of radioactive isotopes, similar to the Earth, not the gas giant's gravity.\n\nThe whole sentence without changes is: The moons of Jupiter are also heated internally by the strong gravity of the gas giant.","116":"The correct answer is: \"Light coming from'straight ahead,' or incident to the lens gets diverged from its path.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The pinhole effect is a real phenomenon where a small hole can improve image quality by reducing aberrations and distortion.\n- The sentence mentions that \"Light coming from'straight ahead,' or incident to the lens gets diverged from its path.\" However, according to the pinhole effect, it's actually the light that is not incident to the lens (i.e., light coming from the sides or off-axis) that gets diverged, not the light coming from \"straight ahead\" or directly in front of the lens.\n\nCorrected answer without changes: \n optometrist\/vision scientist here.  this is called the pinhole effect.  Light coming from off-axis, or non-incident light, you get a fairly clear image without having to change the optics (i.e. don't need your glasses as much).  you can actually make a cheap effective 'pinhole camera' which is easy enough to google.","117":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is: \"Influenza has a low rate of mutation, which means the prevalent strains circulating in a given season have not changed enough for your immune system to not recognize them.\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Influenza has a low rate of mutation, which means the prevalent strains circulating in a given season have not changed enough for your immune system to not recognize them.\"\n\nThe correct information about influenza is that it has a high rate of mutation, which is why the immune system may not recognize the same strains from one season to another.","118":"The action allows us to obtain the equations of motion of a system (namely by requiring that the variation of the action with respect to the path through phase space goes to zero).\n\nThe correct answer should read: The action allows us to obtain the equations of motion of a system (namely by requiring that the variation of the action with respect to the path through phase space goes to zero).","119":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\nThe permittivity of air is significantly different from that of vacuum, so there would be a significant difference between air and a vacuum.\n\nAnalysis: \n- The permittivity of air is not significantly different from that of vacuum. The permittivity of air is actually very close to that of vacuum, as both are approximately equal to the permittivity of free space (8.854 x 10^-12 F\/m).\n- The permittivity of air and vacuum are indeed very close, but the difference is not the main reason for the impedance mismatch in the context of optical Fresnel losses.\n\nCorrected answer:\nThe backreflection arises from an impedance mismatch between the two media. In this case the impedance is related to the electrical impedance, which exhibits a discontinuity at the interface.","120":"The planets all rotate in some direction, and that is counterclockwise if the sun's North is considered up.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The planets actually rotate in the same direction as the Earth, which is counterclockwise due to the Earth's rotation. The direction of rotation is determined by the planet's angular momentum and the conservation of angular momentum, not by the direction of the sun's North pole. The sun itself does not have a fixed North pole, and the concept of North and South poles is relative to the Earth's axis.","121":"Metallic hydrogen is definitely not theoretical and does not possibly exist inside of gas giants like Jupiter.\n\nThis sentence is the factually wrong sentence. \n\nMetallic hydrogen is actually a theoretical state of matter that has been proposed and studied, and it is indeed found in certain gas giants like Jupiter.","122":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It depends.

In reality, when an aircraft is equipped with afterburners, the acceleration experienced by the pilot and the copilot is essentially the same, as the afterburners are typically located in the engines, which are usually located in the front of the aircraft, and the force of the afterburners is transmitted to the entire aircraft, not just the seats.","123":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"As the prefrontal cortex finishes developing, it hinders \"top-down\" modulation, preventing the prefrontal cortex from properly regulating those emotional impulses.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the prefrontal cortex actually develops and matures during this period, allowing for better regulation of emotional impulses, not hindering it. The correct process is that the prefrontal cortex becomes more developed and mature, enabling better \"top-down\" modulation, which allows it to properly regulate emotional impulses.","124":"The whole answer is incorrect, but the factually wrong sentence is: \n\n\"very different conditions.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \n\n\" Mosquito larvae colonize small stagnant pools and lakes and ponds with low currents.\"","125":"The sentence that contains the factually wrong information is: \"Because Bell's Inequality shows that any deterministic formulation of quantum mechanics succeeds in reproducing the expected measured results.\"\n\nThe correct statement should be: \"Because Bell's Inequality shows that any deterministic formulation of quantum mechanics fails to reproduce the expected measured results.\"\n\nBell's Inequality is actually a theoretical framework that demonstrates the impossibility of a deterministic quantum mechanics, not its success. It shows that any local hidden variable theory (a deterministic approach) must be incorrect, which supports the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.","126":"The answer to this is actually more complicated than you would think.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. The statement \"It is more slippery than other materials that seem to be equally smooth\" is generally true, as ice is indeed slippery due to its smooth surface. However, this sentence does not contain any factually wrong information.\n\n2. The statement \"The surface layer of the ice underneath the object is partially melted\" is also true, as this is one possible reason why ice can be slippery.\n\n3. The statement \"However, the reason for how this top layer melts is completely understood by scientists\" is false. While scientists have studied the melting of ice, the exact mechanisms behind it are still not fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research.\n\n4. The statement \"People used to believe that the pressure exerted causes the ice to melt, however, this appears to be false\" is also false. The pressure exerted by a moving object on ice can cause it to melt, but this is not the only factor involved in ice melting.\n\n5. The two current theories presented (friction causing the top layer to melt and water molecules unable to bind correctly) are plausible explanations, but they are not the only theories and more research is needed to determine the exact mechanisms involved.\n\nThe whole sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\nThe answer to this is actually more complicated than you would think.  It all boils down to the fact that the surface layer of the ice underneath the object is partially melted.  However, the reason for how this top layer melts is completely understood by scientists.  People used to believe that the pressure exerted causes the ice to melt, however, this appears to be false.","127":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\nNot any that you could hear if you were hanging out there in a spacesuit, but even in sparser regions of the interstellar medium especially energetic events like supernovae can create shockwaves that propagate for many light-years.","128":"Cats have been dealing with FIV for long time, somewhere in the 10's of millions of years.","129":"The LHC did not have to account for how the moon's gravitational pull moves Switzerland\/France and the bedrock movement did not affect the beam alignment.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) does need to account for the curvature of the earth due to the moon's gravitational pull and the movement of the bedrock, among other factors, to maintain the beam alignment. The LHC is a massive circular tunnel that stretches over 27 kilometers in circumference, and any significant movement of the earth's surface could disrupt the alignment of the beams, which would compromise the accuracy of the experiments.","130":"The exact behaviour is unpredictable but any decent scientist (not me) should be able to look at a formula and make educated assumptions.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. While it is true that predicting the exact behavior of a new, unseen chemical can be challenging, many scientists, including those with extensive experience and expertise, can make educated guesses based on the formula. However, the phrase \"any decent scientist\" is subjective and may not be universally accurate.","131":"The one valence electron is farther and farther from the nucleus, meaning there's a weaker electrostatic hold on it and the atom can ionize more easily.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. The correct statement should be that the one valence electron is farther from the nucleus, but this doesn't necessarily mean there's a weaker electrostatic hold on it. The electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron remains relatively strong due to the inverse square law of electrostatics.","132":"They're not to reduce evaporation, sunlight is causing a chemical reaction in the reservoir that is unsafe for drinking.","133":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"Also, each photon gets stretched out more and more, so your white light looks redder and redder, until it disappears out of your vision.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The answer is factually correct up to the point where it says \"each photon gets stretched out more and more\".\n- However, the statement that \"your white light looks redder and redder\" is incorrect. In the context of general relativity, as light is stretched out due to time dilation, it actually appears blue-shifted, not redder. Red light is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, while blue light is shifted towards the blue end.","134":"The best example organism I can think of would be the slime molds. Specifically one I've had some experience with, Dictyostelium discoideum. For most of its life it exists as a multicellular organism, but when conditions turn unfavorable, the cells separate to form single-celled amoeboids. That might be a way to understand organisms making the jump from single to multicelled.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. The answer starts by stating that it's an example of a single-celled organism that can become multicellular, which is accurate.\n\n2. The mention of Dictyostelium discoideum is also accurate, as it is a species of slime mold that can exhibit both single-celled and multicellular behavior.\n\n3. The statement that Dictyostelium discoideum exists as a multicellular organism for most of its life is also accurate.\n\n4. The problem lies in the sentence \"That might be a way to understand organisms making the jump from single to multicelled.\" The correct term should be \"multicellular\" instead of \"multicelled\".\n\nCorrected sentence: That might be a way to understand organisms making the jump from single to multicellular.","135":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"We always ate a diet of sugary meats and bathed our teeth in phosphoric acid and sugar.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because:\n\n- There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that humans ever ate a diet of sugary meats. \n- Brushing teeth with phosphoric acid is not a recommended oral hygiene practice and can actually damage tooth enamel.","136":"The sentence \"Ashes are what kill a fire\" is the factually wrong sentence.\n\nAnalysis: \n- The correct statement is that \"Ashes are a result of a fire burning, not a cause of it.\"\n- Ashes are a product of incomplete combustion, whereas fires require oxygen to sustain themselves.","137":"They won't normally jump from great heights because they can't see the floor, for instance.\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually incorrect. Mice, being small prey animals, do indeed jump from great heights to catch prey or escape predators. Mice have excellent jumping ability due to their powerful leg muscles and specialized skeletal structure, but they can and do jump from considerable heights. The sentence is trying to justify the idea that mice can judge distances accurately, but it is actually the opposite: mice have poor depth perception due to their wide-set eyes, which makes them more prone to accidents and injuries while jumping.","138":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"It's why you can't taste the inside of your mouth and why you don't notice that you can in fact see your own nose.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. We can taste the inside of our mouth because there are taste buds on our tongues and elsewhere in our mouths, which can detect different flavors. Similarly, we can see our own nose because our eyes can detect light reflected off our nose, allowing us to perceive its presence.","139":"The claim that drinking a hot beverage on a hot day is better than drinking a cold beverage in order to cool down is a common myth.","140":"The C-14 slowly decays (at a known and constant rate) into C-12, so as the dead plant matter goes on in time the C-14 becomes less than in the atmosphere and the C-12 becomes more until there is no more C-14.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"The C-14 slowly decays (at a known and constant rate) into C-12, so as the dead plant matter goes on in time the C-14 becomes less than in the atmosphere and the C-12 becomes more until there is no more C-14.\"\n\nThe correct statement should be: \"The C-14 slowly decays (at a known and constant rate) into N-14, so as the dead plant matter goes on in time the C-14 becomes less than in the atmosphere and the C-12 becomes more until there is no more C-14.\"\n\nThis is incorrect because C-14 decays into N-14, not C-12.","141":"Wind turbines do use starter motors to spin up in low winds.","142":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"Lungs have fewer blood vessels and alveoli on the posterior surfaces. So laying prone expands the lungs more or allows greatest oxygen absorption\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Lungs have fewer blood vessels and alveoli on the posterior surfaces.\"\n\nIn reality, the lungs have more blood vessels and alveoli on the posterior (rear) surfaces, not fewer. This is why positioning a patient on their stomach (prone position) can help improve oxygenation by allowing gravity to help open up the lungs and increase oxygen absorption.","143":"The Local Group basically consists of two large galaxies - the Milky Way and Andromeda - each with their own systems of dwarf galaxies orbiting around them. There are also a few other small galaxies floating around. Then there's quite a lot of open space around the Local Group with very few \"field\" galaxies, until you reach other groups and clusters.\n\nSo the Milky Way and Andromeda are not the closest *large* galaxies to each other. But for each galaxy, the closest galaxy *of any mass* would be one of the small satellite galaxies. Some of these satellite dwarf galaxies are even merging with the more massive host galaxies.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is:\n\"So the Milky Way and Andromeda are not the closest *large* galaxies to each other.\"","144":"The whole answer is incorrect, but the factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"But to say that something *has a temperature* is always going to be slightly squidgy.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because temperature is a well-defined physical quantity that can be measured and is a fundamental property of a system, not a subjective or vague concept. The other sentences in the answer are correct and accurately describe the relationship between temperature and the behavior of objects in space.","145":"The subsequent generations are no longer under the same evolutionary pressure, where genes with a net negative result are no longer selected against.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong.","146":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\nWhen metals are boiled they turn into a vapor or a gas, just like other liquids.","147":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"They are still as fuck on their backs.\"\n\nThis sentence is not factually accurate. The sentence should be revised to: \"They are still more likely to be on their backs.\"\n\nAnalysis: The rest of the answer appears to be based on factual information about sleep and sleep disorders, specifically the effects of CPAP therapy and sleep position. However, the inclusion of the profanity-laced sentence introduces an error and makes the answer unsuitable for most audiences.","148":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nmost of the time, yes. \nWhen a baby is born, doctors can see the characteristics that point to dwarfism, like: a shorter than average neck, flattened cheekbones, shorter arms\/legs but average size hands\/feet. \nDoctors cannot diagnose dwarfism during pregnancy.  Dwarfism, or achondroplasia, is cause by an inherited altered FGFR3 gene.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \nmost of the time, yes.","149":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"If we did not have this filter there would not be too much optical 'noise' in darkness, so the filter is an unimportant adaptation, and a weakness.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The human eye does not have a filter that limits the detection of photons to a certain number. The human visual system is able to detect a single photon of light, and it does not require a certain number of photons to be detected to become conscious of the light. The statement about the filter and the number of photons (5-9) is also incorrect, as I mentioned earlier. \n\nThe correct answer without any changes is:\nTechnically speaking, yes. However due to certain neural filters only allow the conscious brain to recognize light when at least 5-9 photons arrive in less than 100 milliseconds.","150":"The whole answer is factually correct. However, I'll highlight that the original answer is factually correct, but the question is actually asking why the immune response doesn't cause symptoms when exposed to COVID-19 after vaccination.\n\nThe correct answer without any changes is: The whole answer is factually correct.","151":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"It's like comparing peaches and apricots to green beans.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- Peaches and apricots are both types of stone fruits (drupe), which belong to the same plant family (Rosaceae), whereas green beans belong to the legume family (Fabaceae).\n- This comparison is not accurate in the context of the question, which is about the differences between peanuts and tree nuts as allergens.\n\nCorrected answer: \nYou've sort of answered your own question. Most tree nuts are less closely related to each other than to peanuts. It's like comparing peaches and apricots to green beans, you wouldn't be surprised at all when a person is allergic to the first category and not the other. Peanuts are made of different proteins than tree nuts, even though we think they taste very similar.","152":"After analyzing the given answer, I found that the factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Leptin resistance (reduced response of tissue to the hormone) is thought to result from over production by excess adipose tissue in the obese.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Leptin resistance is actually thought to result from decreased production by excess adipose tissue in the obese, not increased production. Leptin is produced by adipose tissue, and in obesity, the body often becomes resistant to leptin, not overproduces it.","153":"There are known elementary particles that have negative mass.","154":"The faster a rocket moves, the less energy is transferred to the exhaust and the more energy is transferred to the rocket.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe analysis of the given answer reveals that the sentence \"The faster a rocket moves, the less energy is transferred to the exhaust and the more energy is transferred to the rocket\" contains a factually incorrect statement.\n\nIn reality, the Oberth effect states that the faster a rocket moves, the less energy is transferred to the exhaust and the more energy is transferred to the rocket because the exhaust velocity of the expelled gases increases with the velocity of the rocket, resulting in a greater momentum transfer away from the rocket. This means that the energy transferred to the exhaust decreases, and the energy transferred to the rocket increases.","155":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\nThe paper \"recoils\" under the impact of the laser.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. In reality, when a laser is shone on a piece of paper, the paper does not recoil. The laser energy is absorbed by the paper, causing it to heat up and potentially burn or disintegrate, but the paper itself does not physically recoil or move in the opposite direction of the laser beam.","156":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"the UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies)\".\n\nAnalysis: The Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies is indeed a real catalog of galaxies, but it is not a widely used catalog for naming galaxies. The UGC is actually a catalog of galaxies that was created in the 1950s by Ola Hannesson, but it is not as widely used as the NGC catalog for naming galaxies.\n\nCorrected answer: \n\nThere are tens of thousands of known galaxies, so giving them all proper names would be a monumental undertaking. To make things easier we just refer to them by their catalog number. NGC stands for \"New General Catalog\", and it is the only catalog used for naming galaxies.","157":"The factually wrong sentence in the given answer is: \"It is only after ejaculation that swimming activity is triggered presumably due to other components in semen.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The statement that sperm develop, retain most of their organelles, and are not dependent on Sertoli cells for protein synthesis and other functions is factually accurate regarding the process of spermatogenesis.\n* The statement that decreased temperature may be protective, slowing random chemical reactions and allowing the sperm to be stable in their inactive state is also factually accurate.\n* However, the statement that swimming activity is triggered after ejaculation due to other components in semen is not accurate. Swimming activity in sperm is actually triggered by the binding of calcium ions to specific receptors on the sperm head, not by other components in semen. This process is a critical step in the fertilization process and occurs before ejaculation.","158":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"However, you would be able to see effects of it passing through.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The sentence is factually wrong because light itself is a form of electromagnetic wave, not a physical object that can pass through a medium like air. It can be refracted, reflected, or absorbed, but not \"pass through\" in the classical sense.\n\nCorrected Answer:\n Light itself emits light, so you would be able to see a light beam midway through its trip. However, you would be able to see effects of it hitting into the air in the room and some of the photons are scattering off.","159":"The correct answer should be: \n\nWhen you donate blood, some (but not all) of the antibodies and cells are in the donated blood. You do not retain enough of them to fight the disease the next time you encounter it.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is:\nWe call this \u201cconvalescent plasma.\u201d\n\n Convalescent plasma is actually the liquid part of the blood that is collected from the plasma of individuals who have recovered from a serious illness, such as COVID-19, and is used to make life-saving therapies. It is not a term used to describe the process of giving donated blood to someone who hasn't encountered the disease before.","160":"Arteries have more rigid walls and appear empty after death.","161":"The wrong sentence is: \"Speed of sound in CO2 is almost 20% lower than air's, if would be noticeable if it worked.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- The speed of sound in CO2 is actually about 0.98 km\/s, which is roughly 98% of the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m\/s). This is not 20% lower.\n\n- The statement \"if would be noticeable if it worked\" is also factually incorrect as it implies uncertainty about whether the effect would be noticeable, whereas the effect is not dependent on noticeability, but rather on the physical properties of CO2.\n\nCorrected Answer: \nCO2 is used for fizz because it dissolves in water extremely well and mostly safe. Speed of sound in CO2 is almost 98% of air's, if it worked.","162":"The factually wrong sentence in the given answer is:\n\n\"Everything that was described by the same wavevector beforehand shares a different spatial coordinate in the focal plain of the lens.\"\n\nThe correct term is \"focal plane\", not \"focal plain\".","163":"The Space Shuttle Main Engines, attached to the Orbiter, are not directly under the assembled vehicle\u2019s center of mass.","164":"The answer with the factually wrong sentence is: \n\nThat's a really great question. If your child is asking about exactly three you're probably in luck because of our bilateral design, but the best I can say is you won't see three copies of an X chromosome in certain females afflicted with Triple X Syndrome.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n- \"If your child is asking about exactly three\" should be \"If your child is asking about three\" (the word \"exactly\" is incorrect, as it implies an exact number, but in this context, the question is asking if there are three copies of anything, which can be a whole number or not).\n\nCorrected sentence: \nThat's a really great question. If your child is asking about three you're probably in luck because of our bilateral design, but the best I can say is you won't see three copies of an X chromosome in certain females afflicted with Triple X Syndrome.","165":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\"You cannot install junction boxes that can fit four plugs that are to code.\"","166":"The motion of particles, for example, is *immensely* complex, so we break it down and name each and every one of the different things going on.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The complexity of the motion of particles is indeed vast, but it's not \"immensely\" complex. The correct word is \"immense\" which means extremely large or immense, whereas \"immensely\" is an adverb that means extremely or to a great degree.","167":"The factually wrong sentence in the given answer is: \n\n\"Which makes a Tesla turbine useless for any application that requires that high torque (such as power generation).\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because Tesla turbines are actually known for their high efficiency and are often used in applications where high torque is not a primary requirement, such as in the power generation of hydroelectric and tidal power plants. They are particularly efficient in converting the kinetic energy of a fluid into rotational energy, but they are not inherently \"useless\" for applications requiring high torque.","168":"The wrong sentence is: \"Potassium Chloride is just used because, like Sodium Chloride, it's easy to make and disolves in water.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that Potassium Chloride is easy to make is factually incorrect. Potassium Chloride is actually manufactured through a process involving the reaction of potassium and chlorine, which is not a simple process.\n- The statement that Potassium Chloride dissolves in water is factually correct, as it is a highly soluble compound.","169":"The torque vector direction determines the axis and the direction of rotation about that axis.","170":"The incorrect sentence is: \"Genetically she is now O+ as her DNA has changed, the eggs in her ovaries now dictate for the production of O+ blood.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- The statement that the woman's blood type changes from O- to O+ is not biologically possible. Blood type is determined by the presence or absence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells, which are determined by the ABO gene. The ABO gene has three alleles: A, B, and O. The woman cannot change her blood type from O- to O+ because the O allele is not compatible with the A or B alleles that would produce the O+ blood type. \n\n- The statement that the eggs in her ovaries now dictate for the production of O+ blood is also incorrect. The production of blood type is determined by the combination of alleles from the parents, not by the eggs or ovaries themselves. The father's O- blood type is not mentioned, but even if he contributed an O allele to the child, the child would not be O+ because the mother's O- blood type would not provide the necessary A or B allele to produce O+ blood.","171":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"A fish that is not receiving enough oxygen will try to compensate by  gravitating toward that area.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually incorrect. Fish do not \"gravitate\" towards areas with higher oxygen levels. Instead, they tend to congregate in areas with higher oxygen levels, such as near the surface or near bubble-producing decorations, as mentioned in the rest of the answer. The correct term would be \"congregate\" or \"gather\" rather than \"gravitate\".","172":"The wrong sentence is: \"The amplitude of the light wave is not related to the brightness.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that \"Shorter-wavelengths are associated with 'higher energy' when talking about light, such as X-, Gamma-, or UV-rays\" is factually correct.\n- The statement \"In sound, the wavelength affects the pitch but the amplitude affects the volume\" is factually correct.\n- The statement \"I've sort of been working under the impression that you can't have different amplitudes of light, and that light intensity is based on the density of photons emitted, not the properties of the photons themselves\" is factually correct.\n- The statement \"Yes, light waves have amplitudes\" is factually correct.\n- The statement \"The amplitude of the light wave is not related to the brightness\" is factually incorrect. In fact, the amplitude of a light wave is directly related to its intensity or brightness.","173":"The adrenal glands has the greatest blood supply per gram of tissue.","174":"The short answer is evolutionary history - it's only been in the last few thousand years (arguably the last thousand) that we've had an abundance of food.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because it suggests that humans have had an abundance of food for the last thousand years, which is not accurate. While it is true that there has been an abundance of food in many parts of the world for the last thousand years, this is not universally true for all humans throughout history. In fact, many people throughout history have experienced food scarcity and famine.","175":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong part is: \"making it easier to digest and grains, calcium, spinach, coffee etc. not making it harder to digest.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- Vitamin C is known to enhance iron absorption, not make it easier to digest. It actually helps to increase the solubility of non-heme iron.\n- Calcium can inhibit iron absorption, not make it easier to digest.\n- Spinach is also known to inhibit iron absorption, especially if consumed in large amounts.\n- Coffee can also decrease iron absorption, especially if consumed in excess.\n\nCorrected sentence: making it harder to digest.","176":"It's very likely to graft a tree onto a non-fruit tree.","177":"The correct answer should be \"The crane is not balanced on a single point on the ground.\"\n\nThe incorrect sentence is: \"With maximal load the center of mass is closer to the 'front' of the crane but still between the supports.\" \n\nThe center of mass of the crane should be closer to the rear (back) of the crane, not the front, when it has a maximal load.","178":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nYes. For example, inverse Compton scattering is used to generate very high energy photons for experiments. You start with some synchrotron radiation (the spectra vary, but something like UV or x-ray), and absorb it into a high-energy electron beam. This greatly increases the energy of the photon, up to even hundreds of MeV to GeV.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n\"absorb it into a high-energy electron beam.\"","179":"The sentence that is factually wrong is: \"There's a lot of clever pruning happening with the neural network but this is the main algorithm surrounding the whole thing.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The statement is true that AlphaGo uses a neural network and pruning is a technique used in neural networks to reduce the number of calculations required.\n* However, pruning is not the \"main algorithm surrounding the whole thing\" in the context of AlphaGo. The main algorithm is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which is a decision-making algorithm that combines tree search and random simulation to make decisions.\n\nThe correct sentence should be rephrased to accurately reflect the main algorithm used in AlphaGo.\n\nThe whole sentence without changes is:\n\"There's a lot of clever pruning happening with the neural network but this is not the main algorithm surrounding the whole thing.\"","180":"The whole answer is incorrect, but the factually wrong sentence is:\n\n'neither the photon or electron are small hard spheres.'","181":"The wrong sentence is: \"Individuals with excess cortisol have been shown to have larger hippocampi, suggesting that certain cells called pyramidal cells in the hippocampus likely grow due to cortisol activity.\"\n\nThe correct statement is that high cortisol levels are actually associated with atrophy (shrinkage) of the hippocampus, not growth. Research suggests that chronically elevated cortisol levels can lead to hippocampal atrophy, which is a known risk factor for depression and other cognitive impairments.","182":"The sentence \"No heat is leaving the car until the sun goes down.\" is the factually wrong sentence. \n\nThe correct answer should be \"No heat is leaving the car until the sun goes down.\" is incorrect. The correct sentence should be \"No heat is leaving the car until the sun goes down\" is incorrect, instead, the correct sentence should be \"No heat is leaving the car until the sun goes down\" is incorrect. The correct answer is \"No heat is leaving the car until the sun goes down\" is incorrect. The correct sentence should be \"No heat is leaving the car until the sun goes down.\" is incorrect. The correct answer is \"No heat is leaving the car until the sun goes down.\" is incorrect.","183":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"But you as an individual have no accurate way of measuring how bad it is for an individual because you cannot go into their brains and feel the same thing they do.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it is impossible for humans to literally go into someone's brain and feel the same sensation as they do. The correct sentence should state that individuals can only rely on their own subjective experience and self-reported measures to gauge the intensity of a sensation, rather than attempting to directly experience it through another person's brain.","184":"The whole answer without changes is:\n\nIf there is a possible surface, yes.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because it contradicts the definition of supersaturation. Supersaturation occurs when a solution contains more dissolved solute than it can hold at a given temperature. When a supersaturated solution is cooled, the excess solute does not condense back out; instead, it crystallizes out of the solution.","185":"The whole sentence without changes is: \n\nHowever, for example we filmed a live giant squid before 2004, and the first pictures of a live one in its natural habitat were taken before 2004.","186":"The whole answer is factually incorrect.\n\nHere's the analysis of each sentence:\n\n1. \"A metal has a partially full conduction band (typically described as a sea of free moving electrons) and there are many energy states for these electrons to jump into if they are excited.\" - This sentence is factually correct. Metals do have a partially full conduction band, and electrons in metals are indeed free to move.\n\n2. \"The electrons in this conduction band are typically unable to absorb energy from all photons of the visible spectrum, so they pass through the metal.\" - This sentence is factually incorrect. Metals can absorb all wavelengths of the visible spectrum, not just some of them.\n\n3. \"Glass and certain ceramics have a band gap that prevents electrons from absorbing photons of specific frequencies, these photons don't have enough energy to allow electrons to overcome the band gap.\" - This sentence is factually correct. Glass and certain ceramics do have a band gap that prevents electrons from absorbing photons of specific frequencies.\n\n4. \"If this band gap's size is larger than the energy of a photon in the visible spectrum the photon will pass through the material and not be absorbed.\" - This sentence is factually incorrect. If the band gap's size is larger than the energy of a photon, the photon will be absorbed, not pass through the material.\n\nThe whole answer is:\nA metal has a partially full conduction band (typically described as a sea of free moving electrons) and there are many energy states for these electrons to jump into if they are excited.  The electrons in this conduction band are typically unable to absorb energy from all photons of the visible spectrum, so they pass through the metal.  Glass and certain ceramics have a band gap that prevents electrons from absorbing photons of specific frequencies, these photons don't have enough energy to allow electrons to overcome the band gap.  If this band gap's size is larger than the energy of a photon in the visible spectrum the photon will pass through the material and not be absorbed.","187":"The relevant calculation, if you wanted to know the temperatures for sure, would be to take the bond energy to be greater than the boltzmann constant times the temperature (in Kelvin).\n\nAnalysis:\nThe answer is mostly correct in its explanation of the factors to consider when determining the temperatures required to break molecular bonds. However, the incorrect sentence is the one describing the relevant calculation. The correct formula should be \"greater than\" (>) instead of \"be greater than\" (is greater than). The correct sentence should read:\n\nThe relevant calculation, if you wanted to know the temperatures for sure, would be to take the bond energy to be greater than the boltzmann constant times the temperature (in Kelvin).","188":"The whole answer is:\n\nIt depends entirely on the people. Birth defects aren't an inherent effect of inbreeding, but the effect of a larger number of homozygous genes. A carrier gene in both parents could display as a birth defect, for example. It's highly unlikely there would be any defects, as the two people breeding would definitely carry genes which would lead to defects.\n\nThe only problem would be a lack of diversity. Eventually, some mutations would arise but not nearly the extent we see today. Technology aside, these people would be easier to wipe out due to reduced diversity.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Technology aside, these people would be easier to wipe out due to reduced diversity.\"","189":"The whole sentence that contains the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"the increase of the stress hormone cortisol has an effect in \"priming\" the brain to be hyper-aware of the surroundings, thus increasing reaction time when a stimulus does occur.\"\n\nThe factually incorrect part is: \"increasing reaction time when a stimulus does occur.\" Adrenaline actually decreases reaction time, not increases it. Cortisol does have an effect on the body's response to stress, but it is not a direct factor in increasing reaction time.","190":"\"Don't worry about it, if it does ignite the atmosphere, no one will blame you.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: \n\n\"Don't worry about it, if it does ignite the atmosphere, no one will be able to stop you.\"","191":"The whole answer is:\n\nSeveral reasons. It doesn't provide nearly enough power for terrestrial applications (the rover can only travel at speeds around 1 inch per second). It relies on very common and inexpensive radioisotopes.

The statement that Caucasians have the smallest jaws and blacks have the largest is a myth and not supported by scientific evidence. In reality, the prevalence of tooth crowding and orthodontic issues is not related to the racial or ethnic background of an individual. Tooth crowding and orthodontic issues are influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, such as diet, oral hygiene, and genetics.\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\nI can't speak to dogs or other non-humans, but in humans, all races do not have the same number of teeth.","194":"The answer with the factually wrong sentence is: \n\nS wave velocity at the surface is going to be something like 2-3 km per second depending on a whole range of stuff.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- S wave velocity at the surface is generally around 2-3 km\/s, so the first part of the sentence is factually correct.\n- The statement \"depending on a whole range of stuff\" is vague and doesn't provide any specific information. However, S wave velocity can be affected by several factors such as the type of rock, temperature, and pressure, so it is not entirely incorrect.\n- The main factually wrong sentence is not present in this answer.\n\nHowever, upon re-reading the question and the answer, I noticed that the correct answer is not the one with the wrong sentence. The correct answer is the one that states \"Problem is that your displacement is not necessarily going to be large.\"\n\nSo, the correct answer without changes is: \nProblem is that your displacement is not necessarily going to be large.","195":"A green filter blocks red light, and the plastic boards reflect mostly red light, whereas the copper reflects a wider spectrum of colors and so appears a lot brighter.\n\nThe correct answer should be: \nA green filter blocks red light, and the plastic boards reflect mostly red light, whereas the copper reflects a wider spectrum of colors and so appears a lot brighter.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it states that the copper reflects a wider spectrum of colors, which is not accurate. Copper is a metal that reflects most of the visible light that hits it, but it does not reflect a wider spectrum of colors. The correct explanation is that the copper reflects a wide range of colors, not a wider spectrum of colors.","196":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong part is:\n\n\"If those reactions produce a detectable odor, then the object is losing mass.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The correct statement is that if those reactions produce a detectable odor, then the object is losing mass in the form of the odor.\n- The incorrect statement implies that the object is losing mass in the form of the odor, which is not accurate. The correct interpretation is that the object is losing mass due to the reactions that produce the odor, not the odor itself.\n\nCorrected sentence: \n\"If those reactions produce a detectable odor, then the object is losing mass.\"","197":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"In times of cold, the blood flow (and the other fingers, ie mittens > gloves) is what causes the fingers to freeze.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"In times of cold, the reduced blood flow is what causes the fingers to freeze.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The original answer starts by stating that there are no controlled studies on the topic, which is accurate.\n- The second paragraph correctly describes the pathophysiology of Raynaud's disease, stating that it is caused by vasospasm of the distal digital arteries, reducing blood flow.\n- The third sentence contains the factually incorrect information. The phrase \"In times of cold\" is accurate, but the addition of \"the other fingers, ie mittens > gloves\" is not relevant to the pathophysiology of Raynaud's disease. The phrase \"ie mittens > gloves\" seems to be an attempt to mention mittens and gloves, but it is not a coherent or accurate explanation of how the fingers freeze. The correct sentence should simply state that the reduced blood flow causes the fingers to freeze.","198":"The whole answer is:\n\nThis effect is not tied to a light sensitive receptor protein called Rhodopsin. It's more commonly known as \"visual purple\" because it is the lack of this protein that causes the dark ghost images seen after looking at a bright object. In your instance, the sun will \"use up\" the visual purple in that area of your eye more quickly. This causes the deficiency that leaves the dark spot in your vision.

In general, swimming underwater is slower than swimming on the surface due to the increased resistance from the surrounding water. This is why FINA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation) restricts the distance a swimmer may be submerged during a race.","200":"We have huge databases of biometrics so it's easy to check how rare it is for people to have the same fingerprint etc.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because it is not entirely accurate. While there are large databases of biometrics, such as fingerprints and iris scans, these databases are not exhaustive, and it's not possible to check every single individual on the planet for the same biometric characteristics.","201":"The actual reason I'm going to highlight the factually wrong sentence is: \"When you stand up and see stars, it's because your body responds too quickly to the need for vasoconstriction, causing your blood pressure to rise and flooding your brain with too much blood\/oxygen.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- Vasoconstriction is a decrease in the diameter of blood vessels, not an increase. \n- When you stand up quickly, your body actually responds by causing your blood vessels to dilate (expand), not constrict, to help maintain blood flow to your brain. This is a reflex known as the orthostatic reflex.\n- The increased blood flow is not due to \"flooding\" your brain with too much blood or oxygen, but rather a normal response to help maintain adequate blood flow to your brain.\n\nCorrected sentence: \nWhen you stand up and see stars, it's because your body responds too quickly to the need for vasoconstriction, causing your blood vessels to dilate, which helps maintain blood flow to your brain.","202":"The wrong sentence is: \"With this I supposed it means O2 in solution in the water.\"\n\nThe correct analysis is:\n- The statement that boiling water can remove oxygen from the water is correct. \n- The laboratory is not the correct context for boiling water to reduce oxygen (O2) in water-based solutions.","203":"The wrong sentence is: \"Memory itself isn't essential to living.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Memory plays a crucial role in various aspects of human life, including learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and maintaining daily functioning. It is a vital cognitive function that enables individuals to navigate their environment, interact with others, and perform essential tasks. Without memory, it would be extremely challenging to survive, and death would likely result from the inability to obtain necessary resources such as food, water, and shelter.","204":"The simple way to approach it is to think of the atom as not being immersed in an electric field which varies sinusoidally in time.","205":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nYes, nuclei have discrete energy levels too, but the excitation energies are typically on the order of hundreds of keV to a few MeV in low- and mid-mass nuclei. So in order to excite a nucleus, a photon usually needs to be a low-energy radio wave.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"So in order to excite a nucleus, a photon usually needs to be a low-energy radio wave.\"","206":"The wrong sentence is: \"This is a major concern for ag crops, since there are wild populations of, say, soybeans in the midwest.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The sentence is factually incorrect because soybeans are not typically found in the Midwest region of the United States. Soybeans are more commonly grown in the Midwestern and Southern United States, but they are not native to the Midwest region.","207":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"9 essential ones that cannot be synthesized from others.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The human body can synthesize all 20 standard amino acids from non-essential ones. \n- There are 9 essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through diet.\n\nCorrected answer without changes: \nYou already solved it - proteins are made from amino acids. Denaturing a protein just changes the conformation (shape) irreversibly. Your body would do that when you eat it. You need 20 essential amino acids in your diet that your body can produce. Your body breaks down those amino acid chains and reconfigures them as needed.","208":"The whole answer contains a factually wrong sentence. \n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Those cells produce little keratin, retain their nucleus, and never become sacks of keratin, surrounded by an extracellular matrix of keratin and lipids.\"\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Keratin is a type of protein that is produced by skin cells, but it is not a component of the cell membrane. Keratin filaments, which are composed of keratin proteins, are indeed found in the cytoskeleton of skin cells, but they are not \"sacks of keratin\" surrounded by an extracellular matrix of keratin and lipids.","209":"The whole answer is factually incorrect, but I'll identify the wrong sentence:\n\n\"Looking at a map, these three deserts look like they are right next to each other.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The Great Basin, Mojave, and Sonoran Deserts are not right next to each other. The Great Basin Desert is located in the northwestern United States, the Mojave Desert is in the southwestern United States, and the Sonoran Desert is in the southwestern United States, but they are not adjacent to each other.","210":"The conversion is is pretty well finished in an hour, and absorption is rapid.","211":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\nTo add to the other answers here, the blue emissions are produced by CH radical species in the flame, and blue\/green light is also produced by diatomic carbon radicals (C2, the \"Swan bands\", named after the physicist who studied them in detail).","212":"The factually wrong sentence in the given answer is: \n\n\"At 0.0106 psi per penny, it would take fewer than 16,172,452 pennies for the bottom penny to be crushed to 0.030\"\"","213":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"You will see other animals have different lengths of intestines.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- Herbivores indeed have longer intestines than carnivores and omnivores.\n- Herbivores have larger cecums filled with prokaryotes that can break down cellulose in plant cell walls.\n- The comparison between herbivores and carnivores\/omnivores regarding intestine length is correct.\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"You will see other animals have different lengths of intestines.\"","214":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If Jupiter's density was made to be the same density as Earth, it would be 1.898E27\/5.972E24 = 317 times the size of the Earth in terms of volume.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The calculation is mathematically correct, but it's incorrect in the context of the question.\n- The question asks for the size in physical dimensions (e.g., diameter), not volume.\n- Density is mass per unit volume, so if Jupiter's density is made the same as Earth's, its volume would be the same, not 317 times larger.","215":"The whole answer is:\n\nWell, depends on how you define pinched. They aren't really pinched because they aren't in the joint barring major trauma.  They can, however, have slight pressure on them at maximal flexion (particularly if you are a bit big) that you would experience as \"pins and needles\" and eventually pain over time.  That would be those in front of the joint. Those passing behind could not be put on slight stretch with the same symptoms. Other neurovascular structures pass beside the joints and don't care that much about flexion usually.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Other neurovascular structures pass beside the joints and don't care that much about flexion usually.\"","216":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\"In fact, even simple kinetic equations can be impossible to solve without approximations.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Kinetic equations are often simplified and approximated in order to solve them, but they are not inherently impossible to solve without approximations. In fact, mathematical techniques such as numerical methods, perturbation theory, and asymptotic analysis can be used to solve kinetic equations even for complex systems.","217":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"melting iron is merely a physical change.\"\n\nAnalysis: Melting is actually a phase transition, not a physical change. A physical change involves a change in the state of matter (e.g., solid to liquid, liquid to gas), whereas a phase transition is a more specific type of change where the substance's physical properties change, but its chemical composition remains the same. In the case of melting, the substance's chemical composition (iron in this case) remains the same, but its physical state changes from solid to liquid.","218":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"Even if you could theoretically grind it into nanoparticles or single atoms, there would be a way for the proteins in your body to interact with it even if it's not in some sort of ionic form-- it would be soluble.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because elemental iron (Fe) is not soluble in water, whereas iron ions (Fe3+ and Fe2+) are soluble in water. The statement that elemental iron would be soluble is incorrect, making the entire sentence incorrect.","219":"After analyzing the answer, I found the factually wrong sentence:\n\n\"Seeing as you're not in airtight room, I'd say anything from 30-50 would be an improvement.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Seeing as you're not in an airtight room, I'd say anything from 30-50 would be an improvement.\"\n\nThe reason is that the statement \"you're not in an airtight room\" is not accurate, as the original question states \"in your house\" (assuming a typical household with some air circulation). However, the correct statement should be \"you're not in an airtight room\" is not present, but rather \"you're not in an airtight space\" is not present, but rather the correct sentence is: \"Seeing as you're not in an airtight space\" is not present, but rather the correct sentence is: \"Seeing as you're not in an airtight room, I'd say anything from 30-50 would be an improvement.\"\n\nHowever, I re-read the question and I found another factually wrong sentence: \n\n\"Each leaf gives around 50ml o2\/hr\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Each leaf gives around 1-2 liters of O2 per hour.\"\n\nA single leaf can produce around 1-2 liters of oxygen per hour, not 50ml.","220":"The unique modern platypus form is a combination of derived (duck-like bill, webbed feet) and ancestral traits (lack of teats, oviparity, fur).\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"The unique modern platypus form is a combination of derived (duck-like bill, webbed feet) and ancestral traits (lack of teats, oviparity, fur).\" \n\nExplanation: \n- Platypuses have teats, which are mammary glands that produce milk for their young, a characteristic shared with all other mammals. \n- Platypuses are viviparous, which means they give birth to live young, not oviparous (egg-laying). \n- Platypuses have fur, not webbed feet.","221":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If by energy you mean light and heat.

But in the main way earth 'uses' the Suns energy, photosynthesis other stars do contribute. Could go far more in depth but not really sure if this is what you mean.\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n\"If by energy you mean light and heat.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it limits the definition of energy to only light and heat, while in reality, energy comes in various forms, such as kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal energy, and more.","222":"The whole answer is: No, there isn\u2019t lots of nucleosynthesis that occurs. A lot of fission fragments are produced from the fission reactions, and you even get a little bit of r-process nucleosynthesis from the huge neutron flux.","223":"The whole answer is incorrect, but the factually wrong sentence is: \n\n\"Basically no matter the conditions surrounding the RBC that is 50\\50 O2 to CO, that RBC will always be less willing to give oxygen to the tissues than an RBC that 50% O2 and the rest is unsaturated.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. A 50:50 mixture of oxygen and carbon monoxide would actually cause the hemoglobin to be completely saturated with carbon monoxide, as CO binds to hemoglobin much stronger than O2 does. Therefore, an RBC with a 50:50 mixture of O2 and CO would be completely unable to release oxygen to the tissues, not less willing.","224":"The wrong sentence is: \"In this example, cobalt has no reason to interact with OH- strongly as it has no full positive charge to interact with the full negative charge on the hydroxide anion.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The question asks why Fe+ does not behave like cobalt and Fe^- does not behave like manganese. The answer correctly explains that the size of the electron cloud around the ion is shrunken due to the increase in inner positive charge, but then incorrectly states that cobalt has no full positive charge to interact with the full negative charge on the hydroxide anion. This is not true. Cobalt does have a full positive charge, which would actually make it more likely to interact with the hydroxide anion.","225":"None of these outcomes are desirable.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe statement \"None of these outcomes are desirable\" is the factually wrong sentence. \n\nThe correct statement should be \"None of these outcomes are desirable\" is incorrect, because all of the outcomes listed are undesirable, but the correct statement should be \"None of these outcomes are favorable\" or \"All of these outcomes are undesirable\".","226":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"I have friends that work with bats and other wildlife and haven't heard of them needing boosters over many years but I'm sure it happens.\"\n\nAnalysis: The statement is incorrect because people who work with bats and other wildlife are actually at a higher risk of needing booster shots due to their prolonged exposure to the virus, not lower.","227":"The sentence \"are you saying that the probability is 60 events every 30 days or are those just some numbers you're making a bet about or something?\"","228":"The wrong sentence is: \"For another, fish will tend to swim closer to the surface to avoid any turbulence.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Hurricanes typically cause turbulent and chaotic conditions in the water, which would likely drive fish away from the surface and towards greater depths, not towards it.","229":"The moon is basically a vacuum.\n\nAnalysis: \n- The moon is actually not a perfect vacuum, but it has an atmosphere known as an exosphere, consisting of gases such as helium, neon, and argon, with very low pressures (about 10^-12 times the pressure on Earth's surface). Therefore, the statement that the moon is a vacuum is factually incorrect.\n\nCorrected answer: \nThese answers are all very speculative and misleading. Phase changes are not (directly) a function of temperature, but are a function of pressure. The moon is basically not a vacuum. A small amount of water at room temperature would not immediately evaporate regardless of if it was day or night. A large amount would eventually freeze if the evaporation dropped the temperature low enough. Look up BP\/FP for extremely low pressure to see how easily water can boil in a vacuum.","230":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"Also, I believe donation blood is treated to kill all white blood cells, meaning no foriegn DNA is introduced.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- Blood is a liquid tissue, not a cell, so it does not have DNA. However, red blood cells do have DNA, but it is not the main component of blood. The rest of blood consists of water, proteins, sugars, and dissolved gases.\n- The process of blood donation involves screening the donor's blood for infectious diseases, but it does not involve treating the blood to kill all white blood cells. The white blood cells in donated blood are typically removed or inactivated during the processing and testing stages.\n- The correct statement should be that donated blood is treated to remove or inactivate white blood cells to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases, not that all white blood cells are killed.\n\nCorrected sentence:\n\"Also, I believe donation blood is treated to remove or inactivate white blood cells, meaning no foreign DNA is introduced.\"","231":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"meaning the faster the wind speed, the faster the air around the body moves away and gets replaced with colder air so the body loses heat faster.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that the faster the wind speed, the faster the air around the body moves away and gets replaced with colder air is not accurate. \n- Wind speed does affect how we perceive the temperature, but it's not the speed of the wind that causes the body to lose heat. Instead, it's the difference in temperature between the air and the body that causes the loss of heat.","232":"The sentence that is factually wrong is:\n\n\"The glass in optical fibers can have losses as low as 5% per kilometer for certain wavelengths (meaning you put 1 W of light into one end, it passes through 1 km of glass, and 0.95 W comes out the other end.)\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because the actual loss in optical fibers can be much lower than 5% per kilometer. The loss in optical fibers can be as low as 0.2 dB\/km for single-mode fibers and 0.5 dB\/km for multimode fibers, which is equivalent to 0.17% and 0.05% per kilometer, respectively.","233":"The factually wrong sentence in the given answer is:\n\n\"Distance below the water line is the only thing that matters; it doesn't matter if there's rock over your head or not.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The depth of the water is not the only factor affecting pressure; the surrounding water density and the presence of overlying water or other objects also play a significant role in determining the total pressure on a diver. The pressure exerted by a given depth of water is not just determined by the water below the diver, but also by the weight of any water above the diver.","234":"The resultant wave is considered to originate slightly beyond the end of the pipe.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The statement that a compression wave reaches the open air and causes a low pressure area inside the pipe is factually correct, as this is a fundamental concept in wave propagation.\n* The idea that air particles overshoot the end of the pipe is also correct, as this is a characteristic of wave propagation.\n* However, the statement that the low pressure area inside the pipe sucks air back in is incorrect. In an open pipe, there is no physical barrier to prevent air from escaping, so it is not possible for air to be sucked back into the pipe.\n* The correct statement should be that the low pressure area creates a region of low pressure near the open end of the pipe, but this does not cause air to be sucked back into the pipe.\n\nCorrected sentence: The resultant wave is considered to originate at the end of the pipe.","235":"The sentence that is factually wrong is:\n\n\"Whether it would be audible or not would not depend on the ball, fluid, and speed.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because the sound produced by the rolling ball is indeed dependent on the speed of the ball, as the speed of the pressure waves (or sound waves) determines the intensity and loudness of the sound.","236":"The correct answer is: \"If the laws of physics do not change with time, then energy is conserved.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The first three sentences accurately describe Noether's theorem and its relation to conservation laws in physics.\n- However, the fourth sentence is factually wrong. Noether's theorem actually establishes a link between symmetries and conservation laws, not just between symmetries and time-independence of physical laws. Noether's theorem states that every continuous symmetry of a physical system corresponds to a conserved quantity, but it does not directly imply that laws of physics do not change with time. The correct statement would be that Noether's theorem establishes a link between continuous symmetries and conservation laws, and it does not address the time-evolution of physical laws.","237":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nIt depends on the type of reactor, and the enrichment of the fuel.

This is because they use fuel at a much higher enrichment level (~75%). \nSource: I use to run one.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement about military reactors using ultra-enriched fuel (>75%) is true.\n- The statement about newer reactors going their entire lifespan without refueling is false. Most nuclear reactors require refueling, even if it's not immediately after each cycle.\n- The statement about civilian power plant reactors typically refueling every 18-24 months is true.\n- The statement that some civilian power plant reactors refuel while still operating is also true.\n- The statement about civilian power plant reactors using fuel at a much higher enrichment level (~75%) is false.

Hydrophilic regions are more accurately described as being attracted to water due to their polar nature, not as having a preference or \"loving\" water.","239":"The wrong sentence is: \"Above all though, spiders are vibration-sensing machines, and not just from their webs, but from any substrate they're on, and the air around them.\"\n\nThe correct analysis is:\n\n- The statement that spiders have extremely sensitive hairs that sense minute variations in pressure is factually accurate.\n- The statement that these hairs or other features do not terminate in chemical sensors is also factually accurate.\n- The statement that spiders are vibration-sensing machines is partially accurate, as they can sense vibrations, but it's not entirely accurate to say that they sense them from the air around them. While they can sense vibrations in the air, their primary method of sensing vibrations is through their legs and the substrate they're on.\n\nThe incorrect statement is the one about spiders being vibration-sensing machines from the air around them.","240":"The whole answer is: \n\n Partial reflection was actually a huge mystery until last century.

Saline solution is typically a sterile, isotonic solution of sodium chloride (salt) in water, but it does not contain other substances that would match a person's blood salt levels. It is used as a carrier for injections, not for emergency blood transfusions to regulate blood pressure.","242":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"As for flowers and trees, the conditions on Mars are extremely dehydrating.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is incorrect because while Mars is indeed a very dry planet, it's not the extreme dehydration that would be the main issue for plants. The main challenge for plants on Mars would be the lack of liquid water, as well as the radiation and extreme temperatures. The Martian atmosphere is also too thin to support plant growth, and the soil lacks essential nutrients like carbon and nitrogen.","243":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\n Our taste did not evolve on the African savanna. where rich energy sources such as concentrated sugars and fats were rare and precious things.","244":"One hundred years ago, Freud was publishing his first books on \"melancholia.\"\n\nThe other sentences in the answer are factually correct:\n\n* The DSM-III was published in 1980, marking a significant shift in the modern definition and characterization of mental illnesses.\n* There is evidence that writers in ancient Greece noted instances of prolonged sadness, which can be considered a precursor to modern understanding of depression.\n* Freud did publish books on melancholia, which was a term used to describe what we now understand as depression.\n\nThe incorrect sentence is the one stating that Freud was publishing his first books on \"melancholia\" one hundred years ago. Freud's book \"Studies on Hysteria\" (1895) and \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" (1900) are two of his notable works, but the term \"melancholia\" was already being used in his earlier works, such as \"Mourning and Melancholia\" (1915).","245":"The whole sentence that contains the factually wrong information is:\n\nThe stress (thermal expansion, etc) of the very fast transition between room temperature and ~3000 \u00baC is less than the stress of remaining steadily at that temperature.\n\nThe correct temperature at which the filament in a light bulb is supposed to burn out is around 2500-2600\u00b0C, not 3000\u00b0C. This high temperature is what causes the filament to break and burn out.

Middle English, which emerged after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, did indeed retain many words from Old English, the language spoken before the conquest. In fact, many words from Old English are still found in Modern English today, especially in everyday vocabulary. Middle English also underwent significant changes, such as the Great Vowel Shift, which altered the pronunciation and spelling of many words.\n\nCorrected Answer:\nYou can test it yourself by reading this untranslated extract from 'The Knight's Tale' by Chaucer:\n\nWhilom, as olde stories tellen us,\n\nThat whilom was ycleped Scithia,\n\nAnd weddede the queene Ypolita,\n\nAnd broghte hire hoom with hym in his contree\n\nWith muchel glorie and greet solempnytee,\n\nObviously reading it is not like speaking it, but it'll give you a better idea of what Middle English was like.","249":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong part is:\n\"It is beneficial because if they are cut at an angle, the crushing of the xylem (vessels) will not cut off the flow of H2O and minerals to the rest of the plant.\"\n\nThe correct statement should be: \"It is beneficial because if they are cut at an angle, the crushing of the xylem (xylem) will not cut off the flow of water and minerals to the rest of the plant.\"","250":"The wrong sentence is: \"Coral is not fussy about temperature, salt levels and small silt particles in the water and can survive a wide range of conditions.\"\n\nAnalysis: Coral reefs are actually very sensitive to changes in water temperature, salt levels, and other environmental factors, which can cause stress and lead to coral bleaching. While coral can tolerate some variation, it is not immune to these factors and can be damaged by extreme conditions.","251":"The babies are heavy and sturdy and resist the flow of the water.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong.

The correct principle of flight is lift, which is created by the wings of an airplane or the shape of an aircraft, not by falling.","259":"The whole sentence that needs to be identified as factually wrong is: \n\n\"The information held in a brain mainly comes from a single, centralized location.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- The brain is a decentralized organ, with billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, and information is processed in a distributed manner.\n- The brain's neural networks are not centralized, and there is no single location that controls all the information.\n\nCorrected Answer: \nIt's theoretically possible, but the brain doesn't exactly work like a computer. The information held in a brain is distributed across billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, and it's processed in a complex, decentralized manner.","260":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"But in addition to this a lack of appetite, exercise (more so in longer diseases like cancer, don\u2019t work out if you have a cold), sleep quality, etc can all affect overall health as well.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. \n\nExercise, even for people with chronic illnesses like cancer, can be beneficial and is often recommended as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. While it's true that people with certain medical conditions may need to modify their exercise routine, it's not accurate to say \"don't work out if you have a cold.\" In fact, regular exercise can help reduce the severity and duration of colds and flu. Additionally, sleep quality, appetite, and overall health are all interconnected and can be affected by depression and illness, but the sentence is phrased in a way that implies these factors are mutually exclusive or unrelated to exercise, which is not accurate.","261":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\"The other thing to consider is that we have thousands of photoreceptors in our eyes whereas insects typically only have millions.

It applies force to the shoulders and torso, tending to rotate you in the opposite direction.\"\n\nHowever, the correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Moving the arms helps counteract this. It applies force to the shoulders and torso, tending to rotate you in the opposite direction.\"\n\nThe correct sentence is actually:\n\"Moving the arms helps counteract this. It applies force to the shoulders and torso, tending to rotate you in the same direction.\"","263":"The wrong sentence is: \"One of the big mistakes people make is that they forget to open the suction and discharge valves so the pump continuously spins the water that is trapped in the casing until it turns to steam and can blow up our cast steel pump casings no problem.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because centrifugal pumps do not spin water to the point of turning it into steam. Centrifugal pumps work by accelerating the fluid (in this case, water) as it moves through the pump, which increases its velocity, but it does not generate enough heat to turn the water into steam.","264":"The net force pushing you to the surface of lava is stronger than the force of gravity on your body in air.\n\nAnalysis: \n- The density of Kilauea lava is indeed around 2.6 times that of water, which makes it difficult for objects to float.\n- The viscosity of lava can vary greatly, but it's not necessarily less viscous than water; in fact, most types of lava are more viscous than water due to its high temperature and the presence of dissolved gases.\n- When an object is thrown into lava, the force exerted by the lava on the object (due to the lava's high temperature and density) would likely be greater than the force of gravity acting on the object, causing it to be pulled down into the lava, rather than allowing it to float.","265":"It will be completely demagnetized.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The first statement \"It is not possible to demagnetize a ferromagnetic material with high pressure or force\" is factually correct. Demagnetization of ferromagnetic materials typically requires a loss of energy, such as heating or demagnetizing fields.\n\n- The second statement \"A way easier way to do it is using electricity specifically high frequency alternating current\" is factually correct. Alternating current can be used to demagnetize ferromagnetic materials.\n\n- The third statement \"The magnet will try to align with the direction of the field but if the frequency is high enough it will be switching faster than the material can align so when the current is turned off everything will end up aligned randomly, making it non magnetic\" is factually incorrect. The correct process of demagnetization using AC is more complex and involves the material's thermal energy being dissipated, leading to a loss of magnetization. The material does not simply switch back to a random alignment when the current is turned off.\n\n- The fourth statement \"Wrong Sentence: It will be completely demagnetized\" is factually incorrect. Demagnetization does not necessarily result in a material becoming completely non-magnetic. The material may lose its magnetization, but it may still retain some residual magnetization.","266":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If you are asking this question with the purpose of colonization in mind, there's no doubt that icy bodies yield the relevant quantity of water needed, and some more.\"\n\nThe correct analysis is as follows:\n\n- The first sentence is factually correct, as there are indeed objects covered in ice and made almost exclusively of ice that can be used for colonization.\n- The second sentence is also factually correct, as comets and the rings of Saturn are composed mainly of ice.\n- However, the third sentence contains the error. There is no conclusive evidence that icy bodies can provide the necessary quantity of water for human colonization. While icy bodies do contain water, it's not always accessible or usable for human consumption, and the process of extracting and processing the water would require significant technological advancements and resources.","267":"The sentence that contains the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"No one has ever made any serious claims as to the size of the entire universe (as in, everything that exists),\"\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect because there have been various attempts to estimate the size of the universe, such as:\n\n* The observable universe is estimated to be around 93 billion light-years in diameter.\n* The multiverse hypothesis proposes that our universe is just one of many universes, each with its own size and properties.\n* Some theories, such as eternal inflation, suggest that the universe may be infinite in size.\n\nThe correct sentence should be revised to reflect that there are indeed attempts to estimate the size of the universe, even if the accuracy of these estimates is still limited.","268":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Changing the amount of grow and dormant times gives you the difference between scalp hair and arm hair.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- The growth period of hair is not directly related to the location on the body, such as scalp vs arm hair. \n- The growth and dormant periods of hair are the same for all hair, regardless of location.","269":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"One specific consequence that comes to mind is kidney stones.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The question is asking about the long-term effects of prolonged 'slight dehydration', which implies that the person is not severely dehydrated but rather mildly dehydrated.\n- Kidney stones are a possible consequence of dehydration, but they are more commonly associated with severe dehydration, not mild or chronic dehydration.\n- Chronic dehydration is more likely to lead to other complications, such as:\n  * Impaired cognitive function and memory\n  * Increased risk of urinary tract infections\n  * Weakened immune system\n  * Decreased athletic performance\n  * Dark yellow urine is a symptom of dehydration, but it's not a long-term consequence of it.\n\nThe correct answer would be: \n\"One specific consequence that comes to mind is impaired cognitive function and memory.\"","270":"The whole answer is factually incorrect, but the wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Yes, light colored skin would reflect less light than dark, and very little light would still enter the tissue.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it contradicts the correct explanation given in the previous sentence: \"Pigmented skin absorbs UV light and prevents more of the light from entering the tissue.\"","271":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Photosynthesis speeds up with a minor increase in heat.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose, a type of sugar. This process requires carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) and releases oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. While it is true that an increase in temperature can increase the rate of photosynthesis in some organisms, it is not a straightforward relationship. In reality, high temperatures can also lead to water stress, which can limit photosynthesis. Moreover, the overall impact of increased CO2 on photosynthesis is complex and depends on various factors, including temperature, light intensity, and the type of plant species.","272":"The whole planet would instantly become engulfed in flames.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. The question is about electron spin affecting the formation of a bond, and the answer discusses spin-orbit coupling and conservation of angular momentum.\n2. The answer mentions that spin-orbit coupling is significant in light elements, which is factually correct.\n3. The answer states that L and S (angular momentum and spin) are conserved independently, which is also factually correct.\n4. The answer concludes that the reaction is considered 'spin forbidden', which is a correct concept in quantum mechanics.\n5. The statement about conservation of spin keeping the planet from spontaneously combusting is a creative but factually incorrect extension of the concept. In reality, conservation of angular momentum and spin is not directly related to preventing combustion or the stability of the planet.\n\nThe correct answer should be: The whole planet would instantly become engulfed in flames.","273":"It is pretty hard to have overturned beds and not deformed.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"It is pretty hard to have overturned beds and not deformed.\" \n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it is possible for a large region of strata to be completely overturned and remain intact without signs of geological folding. The correct sentence should be: \"It is pretty hard to have overturned beds and not have signs of deformation visible and\/or adjacent to your observation area.\"","274":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"The universe does not expand over time.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The observable universe's size is estimated to be around 93 billion light-years across, which implies that the universe has expanded over time.\n- The age of the universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years, which also suggests that the universe has been expanding.\n- The concept of the Big Bang theory, widely accepted by scientists, states that the universe began as an infinitely hot and dense point and has been expanding and cooling ever since.\n- The expansion of the universe is a well-established scientific fact, supported by a vast amount of observational evidence from many fields, including astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence should be that the universe does expand over time.","275":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"This is not how glass cutters work.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The first three sentences are factually correct. Micro fractures in glass can be caused by shock or extreme temperature, and it's possible for a glass object to not break but still be damaged after a heavy impact.\n- The fourth sentence is factually incorrect. Glass cutters are actually designed to score and break glass by applying pressure and heat, not by the method described in the sentence.","276":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"As for in dried up creeks, the fish and frogs go with the flow, so if they realize the water flow is weakening, they will swim upstream or downstream to find the biggest body of water they can.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The statement that fish and frogs in dried-up creeks \"go with the flow\" is not entirely accurate. In reality, fish and frogs in dried-up creeks often die due to the lack of water, oxygen, and food. They do not \"go with the flow\" but rather succumb to the harsh conditions.\n\nCorrected sentence: As for in dried up creeks, the fish and frogs usually die due to the lack of water, oxygen, and food.","277":"The whole sentence that contains the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"Most asteroids do not orbit within 30\u00b0 of the ecliptic plane, so they form a razor sharp plane like Saturn's rings or a sphere.\"\n\nThe correct information is that most asteroids are thought to be in a disk-shaped distribution, but there is no evidence to suggest they form a \"razor sharp plane\" or a perfect sphere. The ecliptic plane is an imaginary plane that the Earth, Sun, and other planets orbit around the center of the Sun, and most asteroids are indeed found within a disk-shaped region around the Sun, but their distribution is more complex and not a perfect plane or sphere.","278":"Something hand-written is always going to seem less \"professional\" than something typed.","279":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong part is: \nA hemolytic anemia cannot occur with a type O mother who has a type A or B child since they do not have anti A and B igG.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- A mother with type O blood does not produce A or B antibodies because she lacks the A and B antigens on her red blood cells. \n- However, she can produce anti-A and anti-B IgM antibodies.\n- IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta, so they cannot reach the baby's red blood cells.\n- IgG antibodies, on the other hand, can cross the placenta and reach the baby's red blood cells.\n- If a type O mother has a type A or B child, the IgG antibodies (anti-A or anti-B) produced by the mother can indeed agglutinate the baby's red blood cells.\n\nCorrected Answer:\nA hemolytic anemia cannot occur with a type O mother who has a type A or B child since they do not have anti A and B IgG.","280":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"your stem cells and germ cells (the cells that eventually become sperm) are also technically immortal.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- Henrietta Lacks' cells are not technically immortal, as they have undergone numerous subcultures and have undergone many cell divisions, eventually losing their original genetic material. \n- Human stem cells are not technically immortal; they can differentiate into specific cell types and have a limited lifespan. \n- Human germ cells, such as sperm and eggs, are not immortal; they can undergo mutations and have a limited lifespan.\n\nCorrected answer: \nwithout going into too much detail: no, there are plenty of immortal cell lines, lacks' is just the most common. your stem cells and germ cells (the cells that eventually become sperm) are not technically immortal. outside of these cells, only cancerous or pre-cancerous cells are immortal. If we try to make all of your cells (or even some of them) immortal so that they can keep dividing indefinitely, your chances of getting cancer will decrease, and you would not age because each successive generation of cells is less mutated, since cells acquire fewer mutations when they divide. in addition, cells can not divide and differentiate (perform their specific functions) at the same time.","281":"The dissolved gas will collect at the interface of the water and other material.\n\nAnalysis: The correct statement should be \"the interface of the water and air\" instead of \"the interface of the water and other material\".","282":"The factually incorrect sentence is: \"That's not nearly enough energy to melt a cube of ice 400 meters on each side.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect. The energy released by a 5 Mt warhead is approximately 20-25 Gt of TNT, which is enough to melt a cube of ice about 2-3 meters on each side, not 400 meters.","283":"The CPU in your phone understands the same set of instructions as the CPU in your laptop.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. The CPU in your phone and the CPU in your laptop are not capable of understanding the same set of instructions. While it's true that the instructions themselves are the same, the architecture and instruction set of the CPU (e.g., x86 vs. ARM) differ between mobile and desktop processors, making it impossible to run the same programs on both without significant modifications.","284":"The sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"There is nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, that we will be able to do in the conceivable future to affect the orbit of either.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because it implies that the total mass of the asteroids being moved to Earth will not affect the orbit of the moon.

Their threshold for most compounds is lower than ours. Therefore, some things we cannot detect at all (below human threshold), are detectable by dogs. Some things we do detect (above human threshold) will probably be less intense for dogs because of their lower threshold. Although, how odour concentration and chemoreceptor sensitivity integrate into subjective 'intensity' is poorly understood and a damn slippery thing to study.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"how odour concentration and chemoreceptor sensitivity integrate into subjective 'intensity' is poorly understood and a damn slippery thing to study.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the phrase \"a damn slippery thing to study\" is not a scientifically accurate or precise way to describe the complexity of the integration of odor concentration and chemoreceptor sensitivity into subjective 'intensity'. A more accurate phrase would be \"the mechanisms by which odour concentration and chemoreceptor sensitivity integrate into subjective 'intensity' are not yet fully understood\" or \"the relationship between odour concentration, chemoreceptor sensitivity, and subjective 'intensity' is still not well understood\".","287":"The vessels under the eyes engorge which results in the bluish tint increasing (like when you see veins under the skin)","288":"The correct answer is: The LHC accelerates protons or heavy nuclei to very high speeds, and then these objects undergo collisions. In those collisions, none of the energy of motion (kinetic energy) of those particles is converted into mass, producing new particles. Some of these will be newly made particles of types we already know, while there is also the chance to see a brand new kind of particle.  Studying what is produced gives us information about the particles that make up the universe and how they interact. \n\nElectric fields are used to speed up the protons or heavy nuclei, while magnetic fields are used to guide them along the desired paths.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"In those collisions, none of the energy of motion (kinetic energy) of those particles is converted into mass, producing new particles.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect.

Compressors are typically used to compress gases in industrial or commercial applications. \n- While fans do move air through them, they do not change the pressure of the air as they move it.\n\nCorrected Answer: \nYes, but the effect is so slight that it would be almost impossible to measure. A fan is basically a high flow low pressure fan. It works by slightly decreasing the pressure on the surface of the blade. And from the ideal gas law, PV=nRT, temperature is directly related to pressure.

Phosphorus is not a water softening agent. Water softening agents are typically sodium or potassium salts of polyphosphates, such as sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) or potassium tripolyphosphate (KTP). Phosphorus is actually a nutrient that can contribute to eutrophication and algal blooms when present in high concentrations in water.","291":"The short term memories are formed by transient synaptic plasticities and Long term memories are formed from these short term ones by Long Term Potentiation (its the most well accepted neural correlate for memory formation as of now).\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- \"Short term memories are formed by transient synaptic plasticities\" is a factually correct statement. Synaptic plasticity is a well-established concept in neuroscience that describes how the strength of connections between neurons changes, which is indeed a mechanism for short-term memory formation.\n\n- \"Long term memories are formed from these short term ones by Long Term Potentiation\" is also factually correct. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a known neural mechanism that strengthens synaptic connections and is thought to be involved in long-term memory formation.\n\n- \"it's the most well accepted neural correlate for memory formation as of now\" is a factually correct statement. LTP is widely accepted as a key mechanism for memory formation.\n\n- \"it's the most well accepted neural correlate for memory formation as of now\" is factually incorrect.

The first sentence is factually correct: Gravity would pull you towards the center of the cube.\n2. The second sentence is factually correct: As you move towards the edges, the pull of gravity still points towards the center of the cube.\n3. The third sentence is factually incorrect: You do not need to do work against gravity to get to the edges. On a cube, the gravitational force is the same at every point on the surface, so there is no net force pushing you away from the center. \n4. The fourth sentence is factually correct: Sitting on an edge of the cube would be like balancing on the top of a right angle.\n5. The fifth sentence is factually incorrect: If you fell to either side, you would not be falling down a hill. On a cube, falling from an edge would be a straight fall, not a fall down a hill.\n6. The bonus sentence is factually incorrect: You would not fall all the way across the face, emerging at the opposing edge just as you came to a stop. In a vacuum, objects in free fall would indeed travel in a straight line, but in the presence of friction, they would eventually come to a stop.","295":"The whole answer: \nIt's a lot more complicated than what I'm about to summarize but essentially: Humans evolved to the point we are at because we started to cook our food. Cooking makes food more nutrient available to us and does some of the digestive system's job for it. That prevented us from taking in more nutrients, especially animal fats and protein, while our digestive systems grew over time. This allowed our brains to grow ever larger and more complex because they had the nutrients to do so. Cooking is why we're us, in large part.\n\nAnalysis: \nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"That prevented us from taking in more nutrients, especially animal fats and protein, while our digestive systems grew over time.\"\n\nThe correct statement should be: \"That allowed our digestive systems to grow more efficient and adapt over time.\"\n\nThe original sentence implies that cooking prevented our digestive systems from taking in more nutrients, which is not accurate. In reality, cooking does make nutrients more available to us, allowing our digestive systems to become more efficient and adapt to process the food more effectively.","296":"The flu does not infect cells and does not trigger an immune response to kill infected cells.","297":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"Ammunition for rail guns are simply blocks of metal, which makes reloading exceptionally cheap ($2K per slug?)\".\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- The answer claims that ammunition for rail guns is made of blocks of metal, which is true.\n- However, the price of $2K per slug is not accurate. According to various sources, the cost of reloading a rail gun can range from $100 to $1,000 per shot, depending on the specific design and technology used.\n- The correct statement should be that the cost of reloading a rail gun is relatively low, but the exact price is not $2K per slug.\n\nCorrected answer: Ammunition for rail guns are simply blocks of metal, which makes reloading exceptionally cheap.","298":"The wrong sentence is:\n\"Each channel is that far apart.\"\n\nThe correct information is that FM radio channels are 200 kHz wide, meaning they modulate the frequency by that much and each channel is that far apart, but the correct unit of measurement for channel spacing is actually kHz (kilohertz), not \"far apart\".","299":"A1\\*U1 = A2\\*U2, larger area (A) = faster velocity (U)\n\nThis sentence contains the factually wrong information.

In the context of the question, the term \"cardiac arrest\" is being used to describe a therapeutic intervention, which is factually incorrect.\n\n- Synchronized shocks with a defibrillator are indeed a therapeutic intervention used to \"reset\" the heart from an abnormal rhythm, but they are typically administered on patients who are in cardiac arrest or at risk of cardiac arrest, not on awake patients. \n\n- Adenosine is also used to temporarily pause the heart's electrical activity in certain cases, but it is usually administered to patients who are already in a state of abnormal heart rhythm, not on awake patients.\n\nCorrected sentence:\n \nThere are also two very short term \"cardiac arrests\" used therapeutically, both to \"reset\" the heart from an abnormal rhythm.

The extra angular velocity gained from launching near the equator does not outweigh the advantage of shaving off less than 1\/60th of the vertical travel distance.","303":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Either way, you will produce less heat if you neutralize with a weak base instead of a strong base.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- Neutralizing an acid spill with a weak base or a strong base is not directly related to the heat produced during neutralization. \n- Neutralization reactions typically produce heat, regardless of whether a weak or strong base is used.\n- The heat produced is more related to the heat of neutralization, which is a characteristic of the acid being neutralized, not the strength of the base used.\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Either way, you will produce heat if you neutralize with a base.\"","304":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is: \n\nBecause the air at high elevations (mountains, for example) is actually more-or-less in thermal equilibrium with the air at sea level, if you take into account the pressure difference. \nSince the pressure is lower at the mountaintops, the air from the sea level will expand as you lift it higher. Expansion, in turn, causes warming. So if you just take a mass of air from the sea level and transport it to the mountain, it'll be around the same temperature as the mountain air by the time you get there.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n\"Since the pressure is lower at the mountaintops, the air from the sea level will expand as you lift it higher.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because air actually contracts as it is lifted to higher elevations, not expands.","305":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If you want the probability of finding your particle in a volume V, you don't have to integrate over that volume.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is incorrect. To calculate the probability of finding a particle in a given volume, you do need to integrate the probability density (which is the square of the absolute value of the wave function) over that volume. The correct sentence should be: \"If you want the probability of finding your particle in a volume V, you do need to integrate over that volume.\"","306":"The sentence that contains the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"However, these orbits are stable: a small perturbation to the orbit will not send them off to infinity or into the black hole.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that small perturbations to the photon sphere (or any stable orbit around a black hole) will not send the light to infinity. In reality, any small perturbation to a stable orbit around a black hole can indeed send the light to infinity, as the perturbation would cause the light to be ejected from the orbit and radiate away.","307":"The mantis shrimp you are referencing are known to have receptors for several more distinct colours, each with a characterized absorption spectrum (how sensitive each is to different wavelengths of light).","308":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Currently, there are known health detriments to polyphasic sleep, but long term effects are not known.\"\n\nAnalysis: The statement is factually incorrect. Research on polyphasic sleep is limited, and there is ongoing debate about its long-term effects on human health. While some studies suggest potential benefits, such as increased productivity and creativity, others raise concerns about sleep deprivation, cognitive impairment, and potential negative impacts on physical and mental health. There is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that long-term effects are not known.\n\nThe correct sentence should be revised to reflect the current state of research on polyphasic sleep.","309":"The red and green components need not originate from distinct pixels on a monitor.","310":"You can't do this with plastic or aluminium for obvious reasons.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe statement is factually incorrect. You can bury plastic or aluminum in the ground, but it may take a long time to decompose. However, it can be buried.","311":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Classical mapmaking would also use triangulation, but obviously we only have one measuring point.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- The first part of the sentence, \"Classical mapmaking would also use triangulation,\" is factually correct. Triangulation is a method used in mapmaking to determine the position of a point by measuring the angles and sides of triangles formed by that point and two other known points.\n\n- The second part of the sentence, \"but obviously we only have one measuring point,\" is factually incorrect. In the context of creating a 3D model of the Milky Way galaxy, astronomers actually have many measurements of the direction and distance of thousands of stars, not just one. These measurements are used to create a 3D model of the galaxy, allowing us to visualize its structure and layout.","312":"The wrong sentence is: \"That's many orders of magnitude more energy than someone jumping though.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The energy of a person jumping and slamming into the ground is not significantly different from the energy released by an aircraft taking off from a nearby airport, especially considering the vast difference in mass and the principles of conservation of energy. While it's true that the energy of the impact might be localized, it's unlikely that it would be distinguishable from the energy of an aircraft taking off, especially with modern seismometers that can detect very small changes in the ground's vibration.","313":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"6 (now 5) possible smaller Sierpinski numbers.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nThe answer states that there were 6 (now 5) possible smaller Sierpinski numbers, but this is incorrect. The correct information is that there were 6 possible candidates for the elusive Sierpinski number, not that there were 6 possible smaller Sierpinski numbers. The correct sentence should be:\n\n\"There were 6 possible candidates for the elusive Sierpinski number.\"\n\nThe correct whole answer without changes is:\n\nFrom reading the wiki page, the Sierpinski problem asks, \"what is the smallest odd natural number k such that k*2^n +1 is composite, for all natural numbers n?\"\n\nSierpinski and others believed that the answer is 78,557. In order to prove that it is the smallest, you simply have to show that smaller ones do exist. There were 6 possible candidates for the elusive Sierpinski number. This new prime number was found using one of the 6 possibilities, showing that that one cannot be a Sierpinski number.\n\nI would love if someone would add in if they have a way that these are useful!","314":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is: \n\n\"Also it may be that the light illuminating the spider web makes it easier to observe.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it implies that the presence of artificial light sources actually makes the spider webs easier to observe, which is not necessarily the case. In reality, the presence of artificial light sources may attract more insects to the area, increasing the likelihood of a spider web being observed, but the light itself does not make the web easier to observe.","315":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If the immune system detects foreign proteins in the body, it will attack those proteins to defend the body against a perceived threat.\"\n\nThe correct explanation is that the immune system attacks the transplanted organ because it recognizes the organ as foreign and does not match the recipient's immune system, not because it detects \"foreign proteins\" in the body. The correct sentence should be: \"If the immune system detects the transplanted organ as foreign, it will attack the organ to defend the body against a perceived threat.\"","316":"The wrong sentence is: \"Ozone depletion is only related to climate change insofar as both are driven by related human activities.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Ozone depletion is primarily caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halogenated gases, which were widely used as refrigerants and propellants in aerosol cans. While human activities, including those related to climate change, can contribute to ozone depletion indirectly (e.g., through the release of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants that can react with ozone-depleting substances), ozone depletion is a distinct environmental issue that is not directly related to climate change.","317":"It occurs to me though that if all the bandwidth was shared amongst the people, that overall performance would be improved and be less affected by a leecher or two trying to get by.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. In a wireless network, \"leechers\" refer to devices that consume bandwidth without contributing anything back, such as file-sharing clients. Sharing bandwidth among users can actually decrease overall performance, as it reduces the available bandwidth per user.","318":"It breaking, and the victim's head snapping back means the victim has absorbed most of the force, leaving the attacker with less pain.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. When a person is headbutted, the force is typically transferred to their head, not absorbed by it. The impact can cause damage to the nose, eyes, and other facial structures, and the victim's head may indeed snap back, but the attacker will likely experience pain and potentially suffer injuries as well.","319":"The whole sentence without changes is: \n\nAutism does cause one to have less empathy per se. It might cause one to be unable to express it or be completely overwhelmed by it. The same applies to other feelings.","320":"The most likely explanation is that planets in general, and gas giants in particular, are **huge**, so the gradient is such a narrow band that it's invisible from the distance required to see the whole planet, or even just a significant portion of the planet.","321":"its about the concentration of blood vessels and tissue in the area.","322":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n Ok, the best theory of gravity we have is General Relativity. GR tells you that gravity is exactly an interaction.\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- The statement that General Relativity (GR) tells us that gravity is exactly an interaction is factually incorrect. According to General Relativity, gravity is not an interaction, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Gravity is a result of the geometry of spacetime being distorted by massive objects, not a force that acts between objects.","323":"IF YOU'RE ON A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS, FINISH IT SO THE TARGET DIES FULLY.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The answer is from a microbiologist, which adds credibility to the information provided.\n* The concept of containing a disease but not eradicating it completely is a valid point in immunology.\n* The explanation about the resistant bacteria surviving and potentially causing clinical MRSA is accurate.\n* The statement about dead microbes serving as food for live ones is also correct.\n* However, the statement \"IF YOU'RE ON A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS, FINISH IT SO THE TARGET DIES FULLY\" is incorrect. Antibiotics work by killing or inhibiting the growth of the target microorganism, but they do not guarantee the complete death of the entire population. In fact, some bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics, and the remaining bacteria can still cause infection.","324":"You may not have detectable antibodies, but that doesn't mean your immune system can't fight them off if exposed.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong.","325":"The moon is gradually getting closer and the sun is gradually getting smaller, so eventually they will be even closer in size.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"The moon is gradually getting closer and the sun is gradually getting smaller, so eventually they will be even closer in size.\" \n\nThe moon's average distance from Earth is about 384,400 kilometers, and it is slowly increasing in distance due to the tidal interactions with Earth. The Sun's size has not changed significantly in the past few billion years, and it is not getting smaller.","326":"Cells don't just add exogenous phospholipids to their membranes.","327":"The earliest Precambrian (Hadean) would have been unremarkable: the Earth was already solid and covered in ice.","328":"The correct answer should be: \"Likewise, more white light in the area washes out and fades colors because of its higher visibility creating that contrast.\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Likewise, more white light in the area washes out and fades colors because of its higher visibility creating that contrast.\"\n\nThe correct explanation is that the factually wrong sentence incorrectly states that the higher visibility of white light causes colors to wash out and fade. The correct explanation is that the higher visibility of white light actually causes a washout effect, which reduces the visibility of colors, not the other way around.","329":"The wrong sentence is: \"We sit in one ourselves so this can be taken into account as well.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Astronomers do not sit in the gravity wells of the objects they are studying. They observe these objects from a distance, typically from Earth or other spacecraft, and use instruments to measure the effects of gravity and redshift on the light coming from those objects.","330":"The whole sentence without changes is: \nChickens have a cloaca, which is essentially one orifice that serves two purposes: excretion and reproduction.","331":"The sentence with the factually incorrect information is:\n\nThe actual electrical energy moves at roughly the speed of sound in whatever material you are working with, even if the electrons themselves don't.\n\nElectrical energy is not transmitted through the movement of electromagnetic waves between electrons, but rather it is transmitted through the movement of electrons themselves. The speed of electrons in superconductors is indeed very high, typically on the order of 99.9% of the speed of light, not \"very, very slowly\" as mentioned in the rest of the answer.","332":"Death however is caused by high levels of oxygen in the brain.\n\nAnalysis: The correct information about CO2 levels and breathing is accurate. However, the statement about high levels of oxygen in the brain causing death is incorrect. Death is actually caused by a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) in the brain, not high levels of oxygen.","333":"The weight of the iron literally flattens them out, removing the wrinkles.\n\nThe correct answer should not include the phrase \"literally flattens them out\" as the ironing process primarily involves the heat and pressure of the iron to relax the fibers, not physically flattening them.","334":"The whole answer:\n\nYes; namely under changes of inertial frames in relativity (Lorentz transformations) E and B fields mix into each other.\n\nAnalysis: \n- The answer is factually correct in stating that under Lorentz transformations, electric and magnetic fields do mix into each other.\n- The answer is also correct in stating that this mixing is a result of the Lorentz transformations, which describe how space and time coordinates change under a change of inertial frames.\n- However, the answer is incorrect in stating that E and B fields mix into \"other things\", specifically into the Maxwell tensor F. \n- The correct statement is that E and B fields mix into each other, but they form a single entity called the electromagnetic tensor F, not that they mix into other things.\n\nCorrected whole answer: \nYes; namely under changes of inertial frames in relativity (Lorentz transformations) E and B fields mix into each other.","335":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\n\"Could be neutrinos (that is an important background process), could be some new particle.\"\n\nThis sentence contains the factually incorrect statement: \"we don't see any of them around on Earth apart from the few known stable particles.\" This statement is false, as there are indeed many stable particles that can be found on Earth, such as protons, neutrons, and electrons, among others.","336":"The mass that's currently there is sufficient to form a planet.","337":"The sentence that is factually wrong is: \"The only practical upper limit of voltage is not dielectric breakdown.\"\n\nDielectric breakdown is a real physical phenomenon that occurs when an electric field exceeds a certain critical strength, causing a sudden and catastrophic failure of the dielectric material. However, it is not the only practical upper limit on voltage increase in a transformer.\n\nThe correct relationship between turns and efficiency is actually related to the saturation point, where the magnetic field becomes too strong and the core material can no longer support it, leading to a decrease in efficiency. This is due to the magnetic saturation of the core material, which can be described by the equation: \n\nB = \u03bc * (N1 \/ N2) * I1 \/ I2","338":"The whole answer is incorrect, but the factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Because the main determining factor in their spread of genes is through their parent (ie the queen), they fight to the death to defend her and the colony.\"\n\nThe main determining factor in the spread of genes in ants, bees, wasps, and termites is actually through their offspring, not the queen. The queen's role is to lay eggs and ensure the colony's survival, but the offspring that survive and reproduce are the ones that disperse and spread the colony's genes.","339":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If your speed is constant then there will be no change in the asteroid's rotation when you started walking, and it would remain at that rotation even after you stopped.\"\n\nThe correct statement should be: \"If your speed is constant then there will be no change in the asteroid's rotation when you started walking, and it would remain at that rotation even after you stopped, because the angular momentum of the system is conserved.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the angular momentum of the system (the asteroid and the person) is conserved, meaning that the total angular momentum before the interaction is equal to the total angular momentum after the interaction. Since the person is not adding or removing angular momentum from the system, the asteroid's rotation remains unchanged.","340":"The whole sentence without changes is: \nAspirin taken immediatly after a heart attack can be very effective if the blockage in the coronary arteries is caused by a blood clot.","341":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nThere are a few things that give rubber some \"stretchiness\". Long molecular chains comprise the majority of elastic materials. However, long linear chains alone don't make something \"stretchy\". More often, they just make it viscous, like a bowl of spaghetti. However, adding a crosslinker, which connects long molecules together in sparse locations makes the bowl of spaghetti more flowable, preventing it from returning to its original state. But the crosslinking connections (added to rubbers via vulcanization, as an example) are sparse and sporadic which still allows the molecules to move enough to straighten when stretched, and coil\/curl\/deform when retracted.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"More often, they just make it viscous, like a bowl of spaghetti.\"","342":"The whole answer is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is: In a quiet environment your sense of hearing is worse than you think. If you stand near a wall, and lean in closer to it with your eyes closed, you can easily pick up audible, \"ambient\" sounds that will tell you fairly accurately how close you are to the wall. We're not bats, but we have a limited ability for passive echo-location... \n\nThe factually incorrect sentence is: \"One of my fave Richard Feynman stories is how we also underestimate our sense of smell -- he had a colleague hold a book in his hand for a minute or so, before putting it back into the bookcase.\"","343":"The whole answer:\n\n The \u2018common cold\u2019 is a collection of multiple viruses, over 200.  Most are types of Coronaviruses (mostly affect the nose) and there are some rhinoviruses in that mix as well.  So there are a bunch of different ones going around that you can get.  Kids usually get a few colds a year, young adults get 1-2, and older adults gradually get fewer and fewer colds because as they catch one and recover, they develop immunity to most of them so they can\u2019t that specific one again (usually).\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \nolder adults gradually get fewer and fewer colds because as they catch one and recover, they develop immunity to most of them so they can\u2019t that specific one again (usually).","344":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"Cognitive decline related to major depression is often referred to as pseudodementia and can indeed be reversed with treatment of the underlying mood disorder. The degree of recovery is always complete.\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"The degree of recovery is always complete.\"\n\nResearch suggests that while treatment can lead to significant improvements in cognitive function, the degree of recovery is not always complete. Some individuals may experience partial or residual cognitive impairment, and the extent of recovery can vary widely depending on the individual, the severity of the depression, and the effectiveness of treatment.","345":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If our immune system fails to do this, and say, a bunch of ameba start eating your brain, then you typically become dead very quickly and then your immune system stops working all together.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that \"if our immune system fails to kill all the microorganisms\" is true, as the immune system plays a crucial role in protecting us from infections.\n- However, the claim that \"a bunch of ameba start eating your brain\" is not accurate. While amebas can cause infections, they typically infect the intestinal tract or other parts of the body, not the brain. Certain species of amebas, like Naegleria fowleri, can cause primary amebic meningoencephalitis, a rare and usually fatal brain infection, but this is not a common occurrence.\n- The statement that \"you typically become dead very quickly\" is also an exaggeration, as the progression of disease and the speed of death can vary greatly depending on the type of infection, the individual's overall health, and the effectiveness of the immune response.\n- The claim that \"your immune system stops working all together\" after the body stops pumping blood is also inaccurate. While it is true that the immune system's function can be impaired when blood flow is compromised, it is not a simple matter of the immune system \"stopping working all together.\" The immune system can still respond to infections, even if its function is impaired, and the body can mount a response to clear the infection.\n\nThe whole sentence without changes is:\nWell, when we are alive our immune system kills all the microrganisms, so that there are no microrganisms in our tissues to try to break them down. If our immune system fails to do this, and say, a bunch of ameba start eating your brain, then you typically become dead very quickly and then your immune system stops working all together. Your active immune cells need very little energy to kill all those microorganisms, and when your blood stops pumping etc. your immune system quickly stops working.","346":"The whole answer is incorrect, but I'll identify the factually wrong sentence. \n\nIt's due to the fact that the esophagus lies directly behind the trachea with only a small sheet of muscle separating the two cavities.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because the esophagus actually lies behind the trachea, but it is not separated by a small sheet of muscle. The esophagus is separated from the trachea by the aortic arch, a major blood vessel, and the right subclavian artery, as well as other structures.","347":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\n Permanent magnets are created by heating a ferromagnetic material to a specific high temperature while exposing the magnet to a strong electric current which is responsible for aligning the atoms in the magnet in a single direction. \n\nAn electric current, and it\u2019s resultant magnetic field is what causes the atoms to align in a ferromagnetic material, to make that material magnetic.\n\nAnalysis: \n1. Heating a ferromagnetic material to a specific high temperature and exposing it to a strong electric current is not the correct method to create permanent magnets. \n2. The correct method to create permanent magnets is by aligning the domains in a ferromagnetic material through various processes such as shaping, cooling, or applying a strong magnetic field. \n3. The second sentence is factually correct, as an electric current does cause the atoms to align in a ferromagnetic material, but this is not the method to create permanent magnets.","348":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Energy is not conserved, and it cannot be converted between different forms of energy.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- Momentum is indeed conserved in an isolated system, as stated in Newton's laws of motion. However, the concept of conservation of energy is also a fundamental principle in physics. \n- The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. \n- In the given answer, the sentence about energy being converted between different forms of energy is actually a correct statement, as energy can indeed be converted between different forms, such as from chemical energy to kinetic energy, or from potential energy to kinetic energy.\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.\"","349":"The wrong sentence is: \"Some cheating individuals have been observed.\"\n\nAnalysis: The statement \"Some cheating individuals have been observed\" is factually incorrect in the context of bird mobbing behavior. In the context of mobbing, the term \"cheating\" is not applicable. Instead, the term \"cheater\" or \"free rider\" refers to a bird that benefits from the mobbing behavior without participating in it. The correct term to use in this context would be \"free rider\" or \"cheater\" as in, \"Some free riders have been observed.\"\n\nCorrected Answer: \nPsychopathy is a complex state, and I'm not sure to what extent it can be assigned to animals. There is some behavior that could be considered anti-social, though. For example, some species of birds that form communities mob predators. If one bird sees a predator, it starts harassing it while giving a particular cry to attract other birds; eventually (hopefully) the predator is driven off, allowing the birds to safely go back to what they were doing. There is no risk of injury or death to a mobbing bird. Some free riders have been observed. These birds hang out with the rest and are protected by mobbing, but don't themselves mob. They get the benefit of mobbing without any of the risk.","350":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is: \n\"Of course in non-western cultures the practice of females removing body hair has never been practiced for thousands of years at different times and places, for example in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Middle Eastern countries.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nThe statement that the practice of removing body hair has never been practiced in non-western cultures for thousands of years is factually incorrect. \n\n- In ancient Egypt, depictions of both men and women with shaved body hair can be seen in art from around 4000-3000 BCE. \n- In ancient Greece, both men and women were known to remove body hair, with the practice of \"deodoratio\" being a common practice among women to maintain personal hygiene.\n- In Middle Eastern cultures, practices of removing body hair, such as depilation and depilatory creams, have been documented in ancient texts and artifacts.","351":"The closer your hand gets, the smaller that force gets; due to the inverse square dependence of electrostatic forces, you notice it immediately.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The statement about the inverse square dependence of electrostatic forces is factually correct. \n- The sentence about noticing the force immediately is factually correct as well, since the force of repulsion between the electrons in the hand and the wall would indeed be strong enough to prevent the hand from passing through the wall.\n\nThe factually incorrect sentence is: \"The closer your hand gets, the smaller that force gets.\"","352":"Modern TGs are 100% efficient at best.","353":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"Fortunately, the feedback works both ways so if you stop ingesting caffeine your adenosine system will revert to normal on the same general time scale.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The correct term should be \"rebound\" instead of \"revert\". \"Revert\" means to go back to a previous state, whereas \"rebound\" refers to the return of a previous state after a temporary cessation or reduction of a stimulus.\n\nThe corrected sentence should read: \"Fortunately, the feedback works both ways so if you stop ingesting caffeine, your adenosine system will rebound to normal on the same general time scale.\"","354":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is: \n\"Chemotaxis is when an organism moves in response to a chemical stimulus in the environment (like how you might move away from an area if you smelled a skunk, or if you moved towards an area if you smelled fresh baked cookies).\"","355":"The whole answer is:\n\nThe problem arises from the joints of the fingers. Each joint has cartilage and on the surface of that cartilage is a protein called lubricin. This lubricates your joints and allows them to move smoothly. Like most liquids, when the lubricin gets cold the viscosity goes down. This increases the friction within the joint and thus makes it more difficult to move.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n\"Like most liquids, when the lubricin gets cold the viscosity goes down.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Lubricin is a solid protein that is deposited on the surface of the cartilage, not a liquid.","356":"The whole sentence that contains the factually wrong information is: \n\n\"Energy is not in general conserved in general relativity.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. According to general relativity, energy is indeed conserved in all cases, including those involving gravitational redshift.","357":"The wrong sentence is: \"This is not a major cause of the loss of SAV beds in many areas, as eutrophication decreases the prevalence and growth rate of said algae.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) indeed has a hard time dealing with epiphytic algae growing on them, as they are outcompeted for light.\n- Eutrophication can actually increase the prevalence and growth rate of algae, not decrease it. Eutrophication leads to an overgrowth of algae due to an excessive amount of nutrients in the water, which can smother SAV and cause their decline.\n\nCorrected whole sentence: This is not a major cause of the loss of SAV beds in many areas, as eutrophication increases the prevalence and growth rate of said algae.","358":"The night sky should have looked much the same on average.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The statement \"In terms of expansion, we can barely see any objects outside of our galaxy with the naked eye (just a few fuzzy blobs)\" is generally correct, as the universe's expansion does limit our visibility to distant objects.\n\n- The statement \"Everything else is in our galaxy and not really subject to cosmic expansion\" is incorrect. Cosmic expansion affects everything in the universe, including objects within our own galaxy.\n\n- The statement \"The night sky should have looked much the same on average\" is factually incorrect because the universe's expansion would have caused the light from distant stars to shift towards the red end of the spectrum, making the night sky appear redder due to the expansion of space.\n\nThe whole incorrect sentence is:\nThe night sky should have looked much the same on average.","359":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nNo, and the reason is the Moon's gravity is not uniform, it has significant \"mascons\" (mass concentration). These perturb low lunar orbits, causing satellites to impact the surface typically within under 2 years. There are four orbital inclinations known as \"frozen orbits\" where things are stable because the effects of the mascons cancel themselves out in the long run, and a perilune 1 metre above the highest mountain would remain stable in the short term. You've also got perturbations from the Earth and Sun, and effects of solar radiation, to consider.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n1.

Cells are indeed attached to the extracellular matrix through adhesion proteins, but they can be detached from it, and it can be ripped away, which is why it's not as strong as implied.","365":"The factually wrong sentence in the given answer is: \n\"Without signals coming from the brain, how does the heart know to increase rate when the muscles and brain require more oxygen during exercise?\"\n\nThe correct information about the heart's control of the rate is not fully explained by the given answer. \n\nHowever, the answer correctly states that the heart does not have an inbuilt natural pacemaker (SA node) and that the brain controls the heart rate chemically through the bloodstream with norepinephrine and adrenaline.","366":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"Ammonia has more vibrational states than water.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The statement about ammonia having lower intermolecular bond strengths than water is correct, as ammonia has weaker hydrogen bonds than water.\n* The statement about ammonia having a higher heat capacity than water is correct, as ammonia indeed has a higher molar and specific heat capacity than water.\n* The statement about the relationship between intermolecular bond strength and heat capacity is incorrect, as heat capacity is determined by the number of energy states (vibrational, rotational, kinetic etc) to raise the temperature, not the strength of the intermolecular bonds.\n* The statement that weak hydrogen bonds explain the high heat of vaporization\/high boiling point of water is correct.\n* The statement that weak hydrogen bonds do not explain the high heat capacity of water is correct, as heat capacity is a measure of the amount of energy required to change the temperature of a substance, not the energy required to break bonds.\n\nTherefore, the factually wrong sentence is the one claiming that ammonia has more vibrational states than water.","367":"The wrong sentence is:\n\"They might do 16, 32, or more dies stacked on top of each other.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Flash memory makers do not stack dies on top of each other.

The correct statement should be \"You need both a combustible material and a source of ignition to get fire\/explosions.\" The presence of an oxidizer in the gas lines can indeed facilitate the spread of fire, but it is not a necessary component for an explosion to occur.","369":"The sentence that contains the factually wrong information is: \"At a certain age young children lose the ability to be self-reflective, and shortly stop being able to model the minds of others.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- Infants and young children are capable of self-reflection from a very young age. \n- Children are also able to model the minds of others through imitation and social learning, and this ability continues to develop throughout childhood.\n\nCorrected answer: \nAt a certain age young children lose the ability to be self-reflective, and shortly stop being able to model the minds of others.","370":"They are still disturbing and slowing the wind - they have to, otherwise they couldn't extract energy.","371":"The JWST will not need to correct its orbit from time to time to maintain its position.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is indeed located at the L2 (Lagrange point 2), which is a gravitationally stable point, meaning that it will maintain its position over time due to the balance of gravitational forces from the Earth and the Sun.\n- The L2 point is considered a stable location for a spacecraft, as it is located at a distance from the Earth where the gravitational forces of the Earth and the Sun are balanced, resulting in minimal perturbations to the spacecraft's orbit.\n- However, the JWST's orbit is not entirely stable and will require periodic course corrections to maintain its position and ensure proper observations.\n- The correct sentence should mention that the JWST will need to correct its orbit from time to time to maintain its position.\n\nCorrected Answer:\nJust a guess, but I don\u2019t think so.  L1, L2 and L3 are negatively stable \u2014 anything at one of those points that drifts away from it tends to keep drifting farther.  So dust and rocks shouldn\u2019t collect there.  (L4 and L5 are positively stable \u2014 gravitational forces tend to pull things back.)","372":"The sentence that contains a factually incorrect statement is: \"We get most of our heat from the sun, but I think the temperature of the crust goes up by 25 degrees celsius for every kilometer or two if you dig down.\"\n\nThe correct statement should be: \"We get most of our heat from the sun, but the temperature of the crust does not increase by a fixed amount with depth.\"\n\nAnalysis of other parts:\n- The temperature at the core-mantle boundary is approximately 5,730F \/ 3,100C, not 7230F \/ 4000C.\n- The temperature of the inner core is approximately 5,806F \/ 3,180C, not 9,806F \/ 5,430C.\n- The temperature at the mantle-crust boundary is not given as 392F \/ 200C, but this value is not provided in the question, so it's hard to verify this statement.\n\nCorrected answer without any changes: I insulation and radiation.  The earth's crust does not provide decent insulation from the heat of the mantle, and a lot of the heat that reaches the surface is not radiated away into space.","373":"All vaccines contain the whole virus.\n\nAnalysis: \n- The question is asking about the composition of vaccines, specifically about the state of the viruses within them.\n- The answer starts by explaining the concept of viruses being \"dead\" in the context of vaccines, which is correct.\n- The explanation of how viruses are killed to be put into vaccines (through heat denaturation of viral proteins) is also correct.\n- The statement \"All vaccines contain the whole virus\" is factually incorrect. Most vaccines do not contain the whole virus, but rather a weakened or inactivated form of the virus, or a piece of the virus (like a protein or antigen).","374":"The full equation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2 )^2.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: An object in motion (relative to some observer) will have both energy due to its mass and energy due to its momentum.","375":"The whole sentence without changes is: \nThe human digestive system is blocked off at several points by several sphincters. This encourages too-early passage of food as well as back-draft from gases. Since most of the gases build up in the final stretch, called the large intestine (which way shorter than the small intestine, but a bit wider), it simply becomes a matter of pressure build-up within a closed container. Once the pressure inside is bigger than the air pressure outside, any opening of the outside sphincter causes the gases to be expelled until pressure equalizes.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \nit simply becomes a matter of pressure build-up within a closed container.","376":"The whole sentence without changes is: \nThere is also a tendency towards greater size being correlated with longer lifespan.","377":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"E=mc^2 is the energy that something has at rest.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The equation E=mc^2 is indeed a fundamental concept in physics, but it describes the energy equivalent of mass, not the energy that something has at rest.\n* The energy of an object at rest is actually its potential energy (in the case of gravity) or its thermal energy (in the case of thermal motion).\n* The correct statement would be: \"The energy that something has at rest is its potential energy or thermal energy, not its mass-energy equivalence.\"\n\nCorrected answer without changes: \nThat is the energy that something has at rest. When something is moving (relative to some other reference frame), it has kinetic energy. When this is slow, this is 1\/2 mv^2 so you could write the whole thing as mc^2  + 1\/2 mv^2, and if you're dealing with relativity then things are probably slow, so the whole thing is still E=mc^2. Equivalently, you can write it E^2 = (mc^2 )^2 + (pc)^2 where p is momentum.","378":"The whole answer is incorrect, but the factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If there's no net torque acting on it, then its angular momentum is fixed in any inertial frame.\"\n\nThe correct statement should be: \"If there's no net torque acting on it, then its angular momentum is fixed in any inertial frame, but if it's not in an inertial frame, it will start to precess.\"","379":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong part is: \"The momentum is essentially transferred from the planet to the air, and then from the air to the plane.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"The momentum is essentially transferred from the planet to the air, and then from the air to the plane, but this momentum transfer is not noticeable for aircraft in flight.\"\n\nThe factually incorrect part is the statement that the momentum is transferred from the air to the plane, as the plane's motion is primarily determined by the forward motion imparted by the Earth's surface and the thrust generated by its engines, not by the momentum of the air.","380":"The wrong sentence is: \"A nuclear bomb was not tested at an altitude of more than 300 miles in 1958.\"\n\nThe factual accuracy of the other sentences in the answer are as follows:\n\n- The first sentence is true: there have been no recorded nuclear detonations in space.\n- The second sentence is true: nuclear bomb tests were conducted at altitudes below 300 miles (480 km) in 1958.\n- The third sentence is true: the space shuttle did fly at altitudes below 300 miles (480 km).\n- The fourth sentence is true: a nuclear detonation in space would not produce a traditional mushroom cloud due to the lack of atmospheric pressure and density.\n- The fifth sentence is true: the energy released by a nuclear detonation in space would travel in all directions, unimpeded by the atmosphere.","381":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"Vitamins, essential amino acids, potassium, calcium, iron, ect.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be \"Vitamins, essential amino acids, potassium, calcium, iron, etc.\"\n\nThe \"ect\" is an abbreviation of \"etc.\", which is used to indicate that a list continues, but it should be replaced with the word \"etc.\" for proper punctuation.","382":"The answer contains a factually wrong sentence: \n\n\"There is no inherent risk with being alive, for any animal.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Being alive inherently comes with risks, such as predation, disease, injury, and mortality, regardless of the environment.","383":"The answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nAnswer: Breasts are supported by suspensory ligaments called \"Cooper's Ligaments.\"  As the woman ages, the connective tissue strengthens and prevents sagging.  This is controlled by genetics, age, smoking, and pregnancy among other things. There has been no evidence saying that sagging is controlled by wearing a bra.  I say this because we can sort of use bra use as a pseudo zero gravity environment (I know its not the same, but in essence they both take strain off the ligaments), so genetics would be a bigger factor than the zero gravity environment.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"There has been no evidence saying that sagging is controlled by wearing a bra.\" \n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because, although there is no conclusive evidence, some studies suggest that wearing a bra may contribute to breast sagging, as it can alter the natural suspension of the breasts and put additional strain on the ligaments.","384":"The correct answer is: \"So keep your battery warm (and dry) to preserve its life.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Lithium-ion batteries should be stored in a cool, dry place, but not necessarily kept warm. In fact, high temperatures can cause lithium-ion batteries to degrade faster, while extreme cold can also affect their performance and lifespan.","385":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"But with so few inputs Bayesian inference can be precise, so your answer could arise beyond \"maybe\" even if the signal is not constant and has not looped multiple times.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that \"Bayesian inference can be precise\" is not entirely accurate. Bayesian inference generally requires prior knowledge or information about the signal and noise, which is not the case here.\n- The sentence also implies that the answer can be determined with certainty, which is not possible without any prior knowledge or assumptions about the signal.\n- The sentence is trying to justify the possibility of a precise answer, but it is based on an incorrect assumption about the capabilities of Bayesian inference in this scenario.\n\nCorrected sentence: \nBut with so few inputs Bayesian inference can only provide probabilistic results.","386":"The reason your arm, leg, ear, nose, etc. hair seems to stop growing once it hits a certain point has to do with how often there is overturning in your hair follicles.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement about hair growth in general is correct.\n- The statement about the turnover time decreasing with age is also correct.\n- The explanation about hair becoming stuck permanently in the valley between production of hair strands (leading to baldness) is correct.\n\nHowever, the incorrect statement is the one about the reason for hair growth stopping at a certain point. In reality, hair growth is determined by the growth cycle of hair follicles, not by the frequency of \"overturning\" in hair follicles. The growth cycle of hair is a complex process, but it's not directly related to the frequency of \"overturning\" in hair follicles.","387":"They've never sent probes that have intercepted asteroids and comets.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe statement is factually incorrect. NASA's Deep Impact mission in 2005 successfully intercepted and redirected an asteroid, 10.6 km in diameter, and the Dawn spacecraft, launched in 2007, flew by Vesta, a large asteroid, and Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, before entering orbit around Ceres.","388":"The whole sentence that contains the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"A gyroscope would dramatically speed up falling.\"\n\nAnalysis: Gyroscopes are actually used to help prevent or mitigate falls, not to speed up falling. They work by detecting changes in the robot's orientation and movement, allowing the robot to make adjustments to its movements to maintain balance and prevent falls.","389":"The full energy equation is:\n\nE^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4\n\nIf you set mass to zero, you can still have objects that carry momentum and energy without mass. Such an object would never have to propagate at the speed of light.\n\nLight isn't really well defined in words, since we don't have anything from our daily existence to compare it to, but we do know all the necessarily math to describe its behavior.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Such an object would never have to propagate at the speed of light.\" \n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because, according to the theory of special relativity, an object with zero mass would actually have infinite momentum, but it would not propagate at the speed of light.","390":"The whole answer. \n\nInfinity is directly a number and not a concept of numbers going on forever. It's like trying to do 2^Pineapple. It's just not going to work because we don't know directly what pineapple is and if it can actually be substituted as a number.","391":"The antennas on a cell phone have to be small, so they can only pick up stronger signals.\n\nThe correct analysis:\n- The statement \"The general idea: the larger the antenna, the weaker signal it can receive\" is factually correct. \n- The statement \"The antennas on a cell phone have to be small, so they can only pick up stronger signals\" is factually incorrect. In reality, the antennas on a cell phone have to be small, so they can pick up weaker signals, not stronger signals.","392":"The whole answer is:\n\nAll electronics radiate energy in form of electromagnetic waves.\n\nThe reasoning is, that the cables that lead from the cockpit to various places on the plane have a zero chance of acting as an antenna which could cause issues with the signal that is being transmitted.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"The cables that lead from the cockpit to various places on the plane have a zero chance of acting as an antenna which could cause issues with the signal that is being transmitted.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because, in reality, the cables can act as an antenna and potentially cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) with the plane's communication systems. The correct reasoning is that the cables can potentially act as an antenna and cause EMI, not that they have a zero chance of doing so.","393":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"It doesn't matter how big your earthquake is if the only component of movement is strike-slip (i.e. horizontal) because it's not going to displace any water.\"\n\nAnalysis: The sentence is factually wrong because even a large earthquake with a purely horizontal component of movement (strike-slip) can displace water and generate a tsunami. However, the likelihood of a tsunami occurring from a strike-slip earthquake is still low. But it is not impossible.","394":"The wrong sentence is: \"Ballooning is when spider babies and some caterpillars spin a strand of silk that carries them on water.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually incorrect. Ballooning is actually a method of dispersal used by insects, such as butterflies and moths, where they use wind currents to carry them away from their parent's location. It is not related to spiders or caterpillars.","395":"The wrong sentence is: \"Rats do not benefit from being very intelligent, and lions cannot survive without being very clever.\"\n\nThe correct statement about rats is true, but the statement about lions is false. Lions are actually known to be skilled hunters and are considered one of the most successful predators in the animal kingdom, indicating that they do benefit from being intelligent.","396":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\n\"The Maillard reaction isn't just a single reaction, it's a whole bunch of things that can happen between sugars and amino acids, leading to a wide variety of complex products. While it is mostly known from cooking and baking, such reactions cannot happen at lower temperatures. They soy sauce fermentation process provides a quite fertile ground for it, since the microorganisms doing the fermentation provide a lot of secreted enzymes that break down the available proteins and carbohydrates, enabling the resulting monomers to react with each other.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Maillard reaction is indeed a complex process involving various reactions between amino acids and reducing sugars, but the statement \"it's a whole bunch of things\" is subjective and lacks specificity.\n- The Maillard reaction can occur at a wide range of temperatures, not just high temperatures as implied by \"mostly known from cooking and baking.\"\n- The Maillard reaction is not exclusive to cooking and baking, as it can occur in various chemical reactions.\n- The statement \"such reactions cannot happen at lower temperatures\" is incorrect. The Maillard reaction can occur at temperatures as low as around 140\u00b0C (284\u00b0F).\n- The last sentence is factually incorrect. The microorganisms in soy sauce fermentation do not secrete enzymes that break down proteins and carbohydrates to enable the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is a thermal decomposition reaction that occurs naturally during the fermentation process, not due to microbial enzymes.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"While it is mostly known from cooking and baking, such reactions cannot happen at lower temperatures.\"","397":"The cases right now are proportionally more in older patients.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The current cases are not proportionally more in older patients.","398":"The correct answer should be: \n\nVery briefly, a precursor molecule called 7-dehydrocholesterol, which is present in our skin, does not undergo a chemical reaction under UV light.\n\nExplanation:\n- The correct molecule is 7-dehydrocholesterol, not dehydrocholesterol.\n- The correct process involves the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3 under UVB light, not a reaction under UV light.","399":"Their surfaces have few tiny scratches and imperfections that repel more water to begin with, i.e. at the end of the rinse cycle they are 'wetter' than the metal and ceramics.\n\nAnalysis: \n1. This statement is partially true. Plastic items can have a smoother surface than metal and ceramics, which can indeed reduce water absorption. However, the statement about repelling water is incorrect. Plastic items tend to repel water due to their hydrophobic (water-repelling) properties, but this is not the primary reason for drying slower.\n\n2. The correct statement about scratches and imperfections affecting water absorption is true, but it's not the main reason for the difference in drying times.\n\nCorrected answer without changes:\n\n Theories:\n\n1. They don't absorb as much heat from the wash cycle as the metal and ceramics.\n\n2. Their surfaces have few tiny scratches and imperfections that repel more water to begin with.","400":"There are several factors.\n\nFirstly, the pacific is obviously bigger so it's normal to expect more islands in it.\n\nSecondly, the Atlantic is shrinking (South America and Africa are moving towards each other) so the newly formed ocean bottom as this happens is at the bottom of the ocean.  Some places in the Pacific are moving towards each other, hence places like Japan and New Zealand.  When two plates push together it makes sense that parts of the ocean stick up above the water.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n\"the newly formed ocean bottom as this happens is at the bottom of the ocean.\"","401":"The sentence that is factually wrong is: \"Evolution does not favor efficiency or effectiveness, it only favors what worked in the last generation.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The statement that evolution favors efficiency or effectiveness is not accurate. Evolution favors individuals with traits that increase their chances of survival and reproduction, regardless of whether they are efficient or effective.\n- Evolution does not just favor traits that worked in the last generation; it favors the accumulation of adaptations over time that have increased the fitness of the species.\n\nCorrected answer: \nDuring embryo development there are lateral and midline structures.  If two lateral structures fuse, they become a single organ, like the liver and pancreas.  The heart starts as two lateral tubes that fuse together.  Compare the anatomy of an earthworm to lamprey, then boney fish, then a human\/mammal.","402":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"it does not cancel out to zero.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, according to the zero-energy state hypothesis proposed by Lawrence Krauss, the total energy density of the universe would indeed cancel out to zero, not remain positive.","403":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"Rapid tests test for N proteins, which are produced with vaccination.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Rapid tests typically detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein) in respiratory samples, but they do not specifically test for proteins produced by vaccination. The N protein is a component of the virus itself, not a protein produced by vaccination.","404":"The whole sentence that is factually incorrect is: \n\"Since everything is held by the same ionic bonds why don't all the atoms disassociate and turn into a liquid of Cl and Na instead of a liquid of NaCl.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nIn an ionic solid like NaCl, the lattice is held together by strong electrostatic forces between the positively charged Na+ ions and negatively charged Cl- ions. When heated to the melting point, these ionic bonds break, allowing the ions to disassociate and move freely, resulting in a liquid of NaCl. This is not because of the type of bonding (ionic or covalent), but rather due to the thermal energy provided to break the strong electrostatic forces holding the lattice together.\n\nCorrected answer: \nThe whole sentence that is factually incorrect is: \n\"Since everything is held by the same ionic bonds why don't all the atoms disassociate and turn into a liquid of Cl and Na instead of a liquid of NaCl.\"","405":"The sentence that contains the factually incorrect information is:\n\n\"If something travels faster than the speed of light in your frame of reference, there are no other frames of reference in which that object will be traveling backwards in time.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, according to Einstein's theory of special relativity, if an object travels faster than the speed of light, it would actually be traveling backwards in time in all frames of reference, not just the original one. The correct statement should be:\n\n\"If something travels faster than the speed of light in your frame of reference, there are no other frames of reference in which that object will be traveling at all.\"","406":"The whole answer: Many turtles have shells that are automatically self-righting, based on physics, but It's very distressing for the turtle. When they're on their back they're at their least vulnerable so as you can imagine, their tiny heart will beat very slowly which is a good thing. Don't try it at home!","407":"The sentence with the factually wrong information is: \n\"Your ship (or you) will experience the same strength of gravitational field at all points.\"\n\nAnalysis: The statement that a ship or an object will experience the same strength of gravitational field at all points near a black hole is incorrect. The strength of the gravitational field varies with the distance from the center of the black hole, due to the gravitational gradient. The strength of the gravitational field increases as you approach the event horizon and decreases as you move away from it. This effect, known as tidal forces, can cause extreme stretching and compression of an object if it were to approach the black hole.","408":"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is launching in 2018.","409":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If you introduce a variable equal to a sum whose convergence you don't want to address now, the convergence becomes an explicit assumption which, if false, strengthens your whole argument.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually wrong because it implies that if you assign a variable to an infinite sum without addressing its convergence, the convergence becomes an explicit assumption that strengthens the argument. This is not necessarily true. In mathematics, assigning a variable to an infinite sum without addressing its convergence is a valid operation, but it does not inherently strengthen the argument. The convergence of the sum can be addressed later, and the variable can be defined in terms of the sum's limit or other properties that do not rely on its convergence. The correct approach is to define the variable in a way that makes it clear what is being assumed or postulated, rather than implying that the convergence is an assumption that strengthens the argument.","410":"The simplest explanation I have encountered is that the metal components of your car (frame and axles among others) do not act as a Faraday cage and lightening would not conduct through it to reach the ground instead of through something with much higher resistance like humans, should it hit a vehicle.\n\nAnalysis: The factually wrong sentence is \"lightening would not conduct through it to reach the ground instead of through something with much higher resistance like humans\". This statement is incorrect. A Faraday cage is a metal enclosure that distributes electrical charges evenly around its surface, making it an effective conductor of electricity. Lightning can strike a vehicle and travel through the metal body of the car, but it is safely discharged to the ground through a path to the vehicle's metal frame or chassis, not through the occupants.","411":"The wrong sentence is: \"Objects can get arbitrarily close, but if you wanted to watch something pass *through* the event horizon, you would have to wait an infinite amount of time.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. According to the theory of general relativity, objects can indeed get arbitrarily close to the event horizon of a black hole, but they do not have to wait an infinite amount of time to pass through it. In fact, the point of no return, known as the event horizon, marks the boundary beyond which anything that enters cannot escape the gravitational pull of the black hole, but objects can cross the event horizon in a finite amount of time, known as the proper time experienced by the object.","412":"At 97F the air around you is barely conducting any heat from your body, but down at 70F it feels just right.\n\nThe other sentences in the answer are factually correct. \n\nAt 97F, the air is not conducting much heat from the body, but at 70F, it feels just right, which is correct. \n\nThe correct sentence should be: At 97F the air around you is barely conducting any heat from your body, but down at 70F it feels just right.\n\nThe correct answer is: At 97F the air around you is barely conducting any heat from your body, but down at 70F it feels just right.","413":"The whole answer is factually incorrect, but the sentence that stands out as the most wrong is:\n\n\"As we age, we make more catalase, preventing a buildup of peroxides which keep our hair its original color.\"\n\nThe correct process is that as we age, we actually produce less catalase, not more. This leads to a decrease in the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, causing it to accumulate and contribute to the graying of hair.","414":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nYes, but it depends on what you mean by \"new\".  Triptans are relatively old news, but work for a LOT of migraine sufferers.  CGRP receptor antagonists are a new class of drugs that are taken to prevent migraines from occurring, but they are still in clinical trials.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Triptans are relatively old news, but work for a LOT of migraine sufferers.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because triptans have been widely used to treat migraines for many years and are still a common treatment option for many people.","415":"The real physical mechanism at work is that \"less dense air rises\", which is a function of both temperature and pressure.","416":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \n\n\"In practice, if you were anywhere near this thing when you turned it on, you'd die before you found out.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. While the process of creating a million-degree object using friction would indeed be extremely hazardous and potentially deadly due to the intense heat and radiation, it's unlikely that someone would be able to get close enough to the object to die instantly before finding out. The heat and radiation would likely be contained within the machine or a shielded area, and the person would likely be exposed to lethal levels of radiation from a safe distance.","417":"The binding energy is really a positive potential.","418":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\n\"Because they're prime (actually, relatively prime is enough, but primes are relatively prime to everything but their multiples), the length of time between double-emergence years (which is the least common multiple of their cycle lengths) is maximized.","419":"The broad base is not to support the structure, as you go up, the radius gets larger to allow for a slower flow of vapour out of the tower (warm vapour will tend to go downwards and by increasing the area, you allow it to go slower).","420":"The wrong sentence is: \"There are practical ways of simulating Mars' lighter gravity and less dense atmosphere here that they could use to test it.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity) is actually a robotic rover, not a spacecraft with a \"Sky Crane\" system. The Curiosity rover does have a robotic arm, but it is not called the \"Sky Crane.\"\n- Mars' gravity is actually about 38% of Earth's gravity, not \"lighter.\"\n- Mars' atmosphere is actually much thinner and less dense than Earth's, but the Curiosity rover's design does not require a \"Sky Crane\" system to operate.\n\nCorrected answer: \"There are practical ways of simulating Mars' gravity and less dense atmosphere here that they could use to test it.\"","421":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"I\u2019m sure there are many more, these are just the two I\u2019m personally familiar with.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because it implies that the speaker has a personal experience or knowledge of many marine pandemics or plagues, which is not explicitly stated in the rest of the answer. The speaker only mentions two specific examples (Sea star wasting disease and Seagrass wasting disease), and the rest of the answer is based on general information about these diseases, but the speaker's claim of familiarity with \"many more\" is not supported by the text.","422":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"This combination of heat and gas being formed causes pressure pockets underwater, which escape violently causing the iconic explosions.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"This combination of heat and gas being formed causes pressure pockets to escape violently, causing the iconic explosions.\"\n\nThe correct analysis is:\n\n- The first two sentences are factually accurate, describing the properties of alkali metals and the reaction with water.\n- The third sentence is factually incorrect because the reaction occurs in air, not underwater. The pressure pockets are formed in the air, not underwater, and the explosion occurs as a result of the rapid release of gas in the air.","423":"The wrong sentence is: \"Cells do not contain endogenous RNases, and the short lifespan of RNA is not an advantage of mRNA vaccines.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- mRNA does degrade quickly in a host cell, which is a correct statement.\n- mRNA vaccines do take advantage of the short lifespan of RNA, as this allows for a rapid response to an infection.\n\nCorrected answer:\nmRNA degrades very quickly naturally. Cells do contain endogenous RNases, and the short lifespan of RNA is an advantage of mRNA vaccines.","424":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"If they are weak (plastic), they will spread out a lot less with application of the same amount of energy.\"\n\nThe correct expansion of the sentence should be: \"If they are weak (plastic), they will spread out a lot more with application of the same amount of energy.\" \n\nExplanation: The correct expansion of materials is due to the coefficient of linear expansion, which is a measure of how much a material expands when its temperature changes. This is not directly related to the strength of the material's intermolecular bonding energy. The strength of the material's bonding energy affects its thermal conductivity and melting point, but not its coefficient of linear expansion.","425":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"This results in higher blood pressure to the brain.\"\n\nAnalysis: The correct explanation is that when standing up too fast, gravity pulls blood away from the brain, causing a decrease in blood pressure to the brain, leading to dizziness, fainting, and dark vision, not an increase in blood pressure.","426":"Since it has nothing to transfer the energy to, would it stay hot indefinitely?\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The sentence is factually incorrect. In a vacuum, the iron bar would indeed cool down over time due to the lack of heat transfer mechanisms like conduction or convection. In a vacuum, there is no air or medium to transfer heat energy away from the iron bar.\n\nCorrected answer: Since it has nothing to transfer the energy to, would it stay hot indefinitely?","427":"Technically, all of chemistry is not a macroscopic quantum effect because the chemical properties of elements and compounds are not determined by the quantum mechanics of atoms and molecules.","428":"The viewer lights up when there is a beam hitting it.","429":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nThe process of decay is not brought on from inside and out by a host of different things. Chemical changes that result from changes in PH. Microorganisms, bacteria, mold etc. Some of these conditions can still occur in the vacuum and extreme temperatures of space, so decomposition to an extent can still occur but it is considerably more likely that without protection the majority of fluids in the body would escape as vapor (I'll leave how to your imagination) leaving the body dessicated rather than decomposed.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"leaving the body dessicated rather than decomposed.\"","430":"The heating mechanism depends on the particular environment -- the gas between galaxies in clusters tends to be very, very hot indeed (millions of kelvin), and emits in the X-ray.","431":"The wrong sentence is: \n\"A photon that is a low energy radio wave photon in one frame of reference can be a high energy gamma ray photon in another.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Photons always have the same energy, regardless of the frame of reference. The energy of a photon is a property of the photon itself and does not change depending on the observer's frame of reference. This is a fundamental concept in special relativity.","432":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Actually, the film has to be very thick because absorption of light scales linearly with absorption coefficient (Beer's law).\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- The statement about Beer's law is true. Absorption of light does indeed scale linearly with absorption coefficient in the absence of scattering. \n\n- The issue lies in the statement that the film has to be very thick. In reality, the thickness of the film can be relatively thin, often on the order of a few nanometers, and the effectiveness of UV blocking can be achieved with thin films due to the high absorption coefficient of the material.","433":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nYes. Animal fat melts around 184 \u00b0C at which point it turns into an oily mixture that burns very well. Fat is a good kindling, meaning it is easy to use to ignite a fire. \n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"Fat is a good kindling, meaning it is easy to use to ignite a fire.\"\n\nThe correct statement about fat is that it is difficult to ignite, not easy to use to ignite a fire.","434":"The astronauts would then make minor corrections so that they would proceed to reentry into Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAnalysis: The statement about the Apollo missions being put on an orbit like this to facilitate a free-return trajectory is accurate. However, the statement about the astronauts making minor corrections so that they would proceed to reentry into Earth's atmosphere after a free-return trajectory is incorrect. The Apollo missions actually used a lunar orbit insertion maneuver, not a free-return trajectory, to enter into lunar orbit. The lunar orbit insertion maneuver involved a series of engine burns to slow down the spacecraft and enter into a lunar orbit.","435":"The main problem with a hand-portable laser right now is the power supply.  Currently, it takes a small handheld battery to get enough power to supply a reasonably deadly laser.","436":"The X chromosome has few vital genes, without the X the zygote could survive.","437":"Typically, particle physicists do not work in a frame in which the center of gravity of the system is at rest.\n\nAnalysis: The statement that particle physicists typically do not work in a frame in which the center of gravity of the system is at rest is generally true. Particle physicists often work in center-of-momentum frames, where the total momentum of the system is zero, which is equivalent to having the center of gravity at rest. This frame is often chosen because it simplifies calculations and makes it easier to analyze the collisions.","438":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"In which case it would be damn hard for us to make sense of it.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"In which case it would be damn hard for us to make sense of it.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because it's stating that the language of dolphins would be impossible for humans to understand, which is not necessarily true. While dolphins' language is likely to be vastly different from human language, it's not impossible for humans to understand. Researchers have made significant progress in deciphering dolphin communication, and some studies have shown that humans can understand certain aspects of dolphin language, such as their vocal patterns and context.","439":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is: \n\nNo, your center of mass will fall at the same rate as everything else. You *can* pull your legs up into the air, though. If you define \"crouching\" as making your head drop faster than it would fall, then you **can** get your head to move down by playing games with the position of your head relative to your center of mass - that is, you can rotate and scrunch up as well as fall. Your center of mass cannot be changed by moving the relative position of body parts. Gymnasts can do some things that appear gravity defying because they are moving their body in ways that change the location of their center of mass.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n\"Your center of mass cannot be changed by moving the relative position of body parts.\" \n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The center of mass of an object or a person can be changed by moving the relative position of body parts.","440":"It's like if you were to put a blanket over a stereo - it sounds different, but everything would still be in the same key.\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually wrong. Putting a blanket over a stereo would not change the actual frequencies of the sound being produced, but it would likely muffle the sound, making it seem different to the listener. The correct statement would be that the blanket would change the way the sound is perceived, not the actual frequencies being produced.","441":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Pure H2O2 is extremely reactive, and infact NASA's jet pack uses it as a fuel, it sprays the H2O2 into a chamber lined with silver, which is a catalyst, the H2O2 reacts violently and expands and comes out the nozzle.\"\n\nThe other part of the answer is factually correct:\n\n- Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an oxidizer and can be corrosive in higher concentrations.\n- H2O2 sold at the drug store is typically more than 3% H2O2.\n- It is not toxic, but it can cause severe irritation and other adverse effects if ingested or in contact with skin.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that NASA uses hydrogen peroxide as a fuel for jet packs.","442":"The wrong sentence is: \"At high energies, even more things become possible (this is what happens in the LHC, where protons and protons are collided with each other).\"\n\nThe correct statement should be: \"At high energies, even more things become possible (this is what happens in the LHC, where protons and antiprotons are collided with each other).\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- The statement about particles scattering or converting is factually correct.\n- The mention of the LHC is also correct.\n- However, the incorrect statement is that protons and protons are collided with each other in the LHC, when in fact, protons and antiprotons are collided with each other.","443":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Light from before the formation of galaxies which we can see is not long, long past.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is incorrect because the light from the early universe, which is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), is indeed long past, but it is not \"not long\". The CMB is the residual heat from the Big Bang, and it has been traveling through space for approximately 13.8 billion years, which is indeed very long.","444":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong part is:\n\"Some people get a runny nose, but that's the closest to the flu-like symptoms you mention.\"\n\nAnalysis: The sentence is factually incorrect because the flu-like symptoms, such as fever, coughing, and fatigue, are typically not experienced after receiving a flu vaccine, regardless of the type of vaccine (inactivated or attenuated). However, a runny nose (rhinorrhea) is a possible side effect of the nasal spray vaccine. The correct statement should be: \"Some people get a runny nose, but that's the closest to the flu-like symptoms you mention.\"","445":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"As they grow up they typically pursue and maintain careers where their diagnosis does not hold them back as much.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The statement that DSM-5 is accurate for ADHD is a factual statement and is correct.\n* The statement that ADHD is more pronounced in kids because they spend most of their time in a structured environment is also correct.\n* However, the statement that as people grow up, their careers will not hold them back as much is an unsubstantiated claim. While it's true that adults with ADHD may face challenges in certain careers, research suggests that many people with ADHD continue to face significant challenges in their careers, and some may even experience career setbacks or difficulties. The relationship between ADHD and career success is complex, and there is no conclusive evidence to support the idea that adults with ADHD will automatically thrive in their careers as they grow up.\n\nThe whole factually wrong sentence: As they grow up they typically pursue and maintain careers where their diagnosis does not hold them back as much.","446":"The whole sentence without changes is: \"Also, a pesticide that can't be mixed with water would be pretty easy to apply.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong.","447":"The wrong sentence is: \"Scientists have fully understood how birds learn to sing.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The answer states that birds that are isolated during development will still sing, and some elements of their song will be similar to fully-formed species-specific song. This is accurate, as birds are able to learn and mimic sounds, including songs, even in isolation.\n* The answer also mentions that non-isolated birds' songs will be more complex and have crucial elements that the isolates lack, which is also accurate.\n* The answer references a study by Slabbekoorn & Smith (2002), which is a real study on bird song development and dialects.\n* However, the statement \"Scientists have fully understood how birds learn to sing\" is an overstatement. While researchers have made significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of bird song learning, the exact mechanisms are still not fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research.\n\nThe correct answer should be: \"Scientists have made significant progress in understanding how birds learn to sing.\"","448":"There is a Japanese lake being examined in the hopes of being ble to calibrate carbon dating with leaves that are tens of thousands of years old.\n\nThe factually incorrect sentence is: \"There is a Japanese lake being examined in the hopes of being ble to calibrate carbon dating with leaves that are tens of thousands of years old.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"There is a Japanese lake being examined in the hopes of being able to calibrate carbon dating with leaves that are tens of thousands of years old.\"\n\nThe correct word is \"able\", not \"ble\".","449":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\nAlcohol, at least as sold in the US, has to put nutritional information on their packaging, so it's understandable that not as many people know that one gram of (pure) alcohol has 7 calories.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong.

Helium was discovered by Jules Janssen and Norman Lockyer in 1868, and it was initially named \"neon\" by Janssen. Later, in 1895, French chemist William Ramsay discovered a new element with the same properties, which he named helium.\n\nCorrected sentence: Helium was first discovered as an absorption line in the sun which didn't match any known element so it was named Helium by Jules Janssen.","451":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"M87 is not oriented towards us so that the center of the galaxy is easily viewed and M87 is not home to a truly gargantuan black hole that is not actively consuming material and not producing brilliant jets of material radiating away from the \"north\" and \"south\" poles of the galaxy.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The sentence mentions that M87 is not oriented towards us, which is not accurate. M87 is actually one of the closest supermassive black holes to Earth, and it is located in the constellation Virgo, which is visible to the naked eye. \n* The sentence also claims that M87 is not home to a truly gargantuan black hole, which is incorrect. M87* is indeed a supermassive black hole with a mass of approximately 6.5 billion times that of the sun.\n* The sentence mentions that the black hole is not actively consuming material and not producing brilliant jets of material radiating away from the \"north\" and \"south\" poles of the galaxy. While it is true that the black hole at the center of the Milky Way is not actively consuming material, the statement about the jets of material is incorrect. M87* does produce jets of material that radiate away from its poles, but this is not unique to M87 and is a common feature of many active galactic nuclei (AGN).","452":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\"Although, if the density of supermassive black holes is actually pretty low.\"","453":"The largest optical telescopes in the world are about 10 meters so it is basically impossible take a photo of the site from Earth.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. The largest optical telescopes in the world are actually around 8.2 meters (28 feet) in diameter, such as the Mauna Kea Observatories, but there are also larger telescopes, like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) under construction, which will have a primary mirror diameter of 39 meters (128 feet).","454":"The whole sentence without changes is: \"Words such as like, um, you know, uh and other fillers actually form an important part of speech as conversation managers.  They indicate you are pausing, perhaps to think of a word, rather than done talking.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because the word \"done\" should be \"done talking\".","455":"The few migratory species of hummingbird all make their journeys solo (even the juveniles), mostly during the day.","456":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"For instance, scotch is aged in charred oak bourbon or sherry barrels (meaning they had previously been used to age bourbon or sherry).\"\n\nThe correct information about scotch aging is that it is typically aged in charred oak barrels, but the barrels are not previously used to age bourbon or sherry.

When you run, you typically sweat, not freeze. Sweating is a natural response to increased body temperature, which is a sign of physical exertion, whereas freezing is a sign of extreme cold exposure, and it's not a physiological response to running.","458":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"When a photon interacts with the surface of a mirror, the photon is absorbed by the material of the mirror.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The first part of the answer is accurate: photons can indeed bounce off a mirror, but the representation of photons as billiard balls is an oversimplification.\n* The second part of the answer is also accurate: when a photon interacts with the surface of a mirror, it can be absorbed by the material of the mirror.\n* The third part of the answer is accurate: when a photon is absorbed, the particles in the mirror surface can be knocked into a higher energy state, which can lead to the emission of a new photon.\n\nHowever, the factually wrong sentence is actually the fourth sentence: \"In this process, the particles belonging to the mirror surface are knocked into a higher energy state, which almost immediately collapses back to the ground level, emitting a completely new photon.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the particles in the mirror surface do not collapse back to the ground level immediately. Instead, they transition to an excited state, which can release energy in the form of a new photon through various processes such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, or thermalization.\n\nCorrected answer without the factually wrong sentence: \nThe common representation of photons bouncing off a mirror like billiard balls isn't very accurate.\n\nWhen a photon interacts with the surface of a mirror, the photon is absorbed by the material of the mirror. At that point, the photon continues to exist. In this process, the particles belonging to the mirror surface are knocked into a higher energy state, which can lead to the emission of a new photon.","459":"The whole answer without changes is:\n\nTechnically yes. At absolute zero, - 273.15 C, entropy reaches its lowest value. At absolute zero, molecular activity increases, and since combustion is a reaction involving excitation, fire as we know it can exist at absolute zero. But, the laws of thermodynamics state that zero can't be reached by only thermodynamic means, the closest we've got is in a lab, so there's not going to be anywhere in nature its impossible to start a fire based on temperature alone.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is:\n\"the closest we've got is in a lab, so there's not going to be anywhere in nature its impossible to start a fire based on temperature alone.\"","460":"The wrong sentence is: \"Using a click type torque wrench both directions will actually decrease it's accuracy more quickly over time\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Using a click-type torque wrench in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions will not decrease its accuracy more quickly over time. The accuracy of a click-type torque wrench is affected by wear and tear, but it is not specifically related to the direction of use.","461":"The jets consist of matter that never entered the black hole in the first place.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. The jets that are observed coming out of black holes are indeed thought to be a result of matter that has already fallen into the black hole, not matter that never entered it in the first place. The correct explanation is that the accretion disk is plasma spinning extremely rapidly, and in the process of matter falling onto the black hole, electromagnetic effects cause a small portion of the infalling matter to be ejected at highly relativistic velocity (the exact launching mechanism is not well understood).","462":"The whole answer is factually accurate, but I'll point out that the sentence \"Gas isn't exchanged between the lungs and blood when they dive so the amount of nitrogen is constant through the whole dive and does get super saturated at depth.\" is not entirely accurate. \n\nGas exchange does occur in the lungs of deep-sea creatures, although it may be less efficient than in humans. However, the key factor preventing the buildup of nitrogen bubbles is the slow and gradual change in pressure, not the absence of gas exchange.\n\nThe correct answer without changes is:\nThey don't store oxygen in their lungs like we do, they store it in haemoglobin in their blood and myoglobin in their muscles. Gas isn't exchanged between the lungs and blood when they dive so the amount of nitrogen is constant through the whole dive and does get super saturated at depth. This means it doesn't come out of solution as gas when the pressure decreases as they surface.","463":"The whole answer is factually incorrect. However, the sentence that stands out as factually wrong is:\n\n\"If the pharynx at the back of the throat is inflamed and congested, the nerves carrying pain fibres in that area are stimulated to give a painful swallowing.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. The correct explanation for painful swallowing (dysphagia) in the context of a common cold is that the inflammation and congestion in the pharynx can cause irritation of the nerve endings, leading to pain. However, the primary cause of painful swallowing in a cold is not the stimulation of nerves carrying pain fibers, but rather the direct irritation of the nerve endings in the pharynx by the inflammatory mediators released during the infection.\n\nThe correct explanation is that the inflammation and congestion in the pharynx can cause irritation of the nerve endings, leading to pain, and the swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck can also refer pain to the throat area.\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"The inflammation and congestion in the pharynx can cause irritation of the nerve endings, leading to pain.\"","464":"The whole sentence that contains the factually wrong information is:\n\n\"Carbonated water used in beverages typically contains about 0.04% CO2, maybe less, whereas Earth's atmosphere is 0.2% CO2 and oceanic CO2 roughly the same (+\/- less than 0.01%).\"","465":"The resulting impact would likely create a massive shockwave that would cause widespread destruction, triggering massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.","466":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nMuscles are very opaque to visible light.

The Roche limit is actually a distance within which the tidal forces would break apart a satellite, not the object itself.\n\n- The size of Jupiter would not remain the same during a collision with Earth. In fact, the impact would likely cause Jupiter to deform and possibly break apart, with the Earth being torn apart or vaporized in the process.\n\n- The correct outcome of a collision between Earth and Jupiter is not that the two objects would collide and then separate without any damage. Instead, the impact would be catastrophic, with the Earth being destroyed and Jupiter's massive size and gravity causing a significant portion of the Earth's crust and atmosphere to be torn apart.","468":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is:\n\n\"This is because a galaxy does not consist mostly of space.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* Galaxies are massive, gravitationally bound systems consisting of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter, spread across a vast region of space. \n* The statement that a galaxy consists mostly of space is factually incorrect.","469":"The whole answer without changes is: \nWith small currents, no heat would be produced. In fact, in a superconductor, you can have a loop of wire with no battery in it but with current flowing. However, there is a maximum current at which materials cease to be superconducting, which would cause no energy to be lost to heat at large currents.","470":"The wrong sentence is: \"I think the best way to think of it is that genes set the outer boundaries of intelligence and environment decides where you land on that spectrum.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it implies that genes set the outer boundaries of intelligence, suggesting a fixed genetic component. However, most research suggests that the relationship between genetics and intelligence is more complex and that environment plays a significant role in shaping intelligence, especially in childhood and adolescence. The correct statement should acknowledge that environment influences intelligence, but also recognize that genetics also contributes to individual differences in intelligence.","471":"The classic example is beta decay, where a neutron turns into a proton and an electron while absorbing a neutrino.\n\nAnalysis: The statement about the weak nuclear force being an interaction and the description of beta decay is factually correct. However, the weak nuclear force is indeed a force, not just an interaction, as it is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The fact that it is a force is correctly stated, but the description of it as \"f=ma\" is incorrect, as the weak nuclear force is not a force in the classical sense (force = mass x acceleration).","472":"The reason why you don't see the compass needle move is because the magnetic field from the moving magnet is cancelling out the magnetic field in the compass.","473":"The separation of the southern hemisphere's continents from Antarctica did not cause the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. The statement about the placement of continents having a big effect on ocean currents and weather patterns is factually accurate.\n2. The formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is indeed influenced by the separation of the southern hemisphere's continents from Antarctica.\n3. However, the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet is a complex process that occurred over millions of years, and its primary driver is thought to be changes in Earth's orbit and climate, rather than the separation of the continents from Antarctica.\n\nTherefore, the factually incorrect sentence is: \nThe separation of the southern hemisphere's continents from Antarctica did not cause the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet.","474":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Cytoplasmic Inheritance refers to the offspring receiving actual genes (DNA) from the mother that are not in the nucleus, mostly from the mitochondria, chloroplast and possibly from any viruses.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because Cytoplasmic Inheritance actually refers to the transmission of traits from the mother to the offspring through the cytoplasm, which can be due to various factors such as mitochondria or chloroplasts, but not directly from viruses.","475":"The wrong sentence is: \"In three dimensions, this has one independent component, and can be written as a (pseudo)scalar; in two dimensions, this has three independent components, and can be grouped into a (pseudo)vector.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- In three dimensions, angular momentum is indeed a pseudovector because it is an antisymmetric matrix with one independent component, which is the scalar value of the angular momentum. \n- In two dimensions, angular momentum is a pseudovector because it is an antisymmetric matrix with three independent components, not a scalar.","476":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Absorb possibly contaminated mucus from the body\".\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the correct function of coughing and sneezing is not to absorb contaminated mucus from the body, but rather to expel it, helping to clear out pathogens and irritants from the respiratory tract.","477":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is:\n\nThe sine function gives a wave when plotted in a graph, but it is also the ratio of two specific sides of a triangle for a given angle.","478":"After analyzing the given answer, I found the factually wrong sentence:\n\n\"Im a 3rd year medical student in the US.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it is not possible for a medical student to be a 3rd year student in the US, as the typical medical education system in the US is 4 years long, and medical students complete their residency after graduation.\n\nCorrected answer:\nA Bacteria causing a urinary tract infection can tract up through the bladder and up the ureter and to the kidneys. This infection is called pyelonephritis. Two things can happen: sepsis and kidney failure. Sepsis is when this bacteria gets into the blood and the toxins produced by the bacteria prevent fluids from leaking out of blood vessels causing extremely high blood pressures and clear mental status, no fever, and ultimately recovery without intervention. The other possibility is kidney failure. The kidney filters BUN (Blood urea nitrogen). When BUN can't be filtered out these toxins can build up and cause altered mental status as well. BUN\/Creatinine ratio (a blood test calculation derived from looking at amounts of nitrogen and creatinine in the blood) can be used to test a kidney's filter function.","479":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is: \nThe force the magnet would exert on the bar is not linearly proportional to the magnetic field, and the field itself does not diminish very quickly. The field is proportional to 1\/x^3 where x is the distance in question.\n\nAnalysis: \n\n- The statement \"The force the magnet would exert on the bar is not linearly proportional to the magnetic field\" is factually correct. \n- The statement \"the field itself does not diminish very quickly\" is also factually correct. \n- The statement \"The field is proportional to 1\/x^3 where x is the distance in question\" is factually incorrect. \n\nThe correct statement should be that the magnetic field decreases with the square of the distance, not the cube. The correct formula is B \u221d 1\/r^2, where B is the magnetic field strength and r is the distance between the magnet and the bar.","480":"The sentence that is factually wrong is: \n\n\"Bacteria and other organisms do not condense and coagulate their intracellular proteins, allowing the ethanol to penetrate further into the cell wall.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect. Bacteria and other microorganisms do not condense and coagulate their intracellular proteins due to ethanol. The actual mechanism of action of ethanol as an antimicrobial agent involves denaturing proteins, disrupting cell membranes, and ultimately leading to cell lysis, not the coagulation of intracellular proteins.","481":"The wrong sentence is: \"If someone is hypovolemic enough, they will be able to maintain an adequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to their organs.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The correct concept is that severe dehydration can lead to a decrease in blood volume, which can cause a decrease in blood pressure, not an increase in blood pressure. A decrease in blood pressure can lead to inadequate blood flow to organs, including the brain, which can cause organ damage or failure.\n* The correct term for a person with low blood volume is \"hypovolemic\", not \"hypervolemic\".\n\nCorrected Wrong Sentence: \nIf someone is hypovolemic enough, they will experience a decrease in blood pressure, leading to inadequate blood flow to their organs.","482":"The answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nAnswer: It's determined by international trade.

The individuals could be located in any country, and the exchange of goods and services could occur between citizens of different countries.","483":"The factually wrong sentence in the given answer is: \"Is the principle of gold connectors just a marketing hoax?\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. The question is asking about the reason for using gold in connector ends, specifically in USB-connectors for gaming mice.\n2. The answer provides a formula for calculating ideal resistance using resistivity, length, and area.\n3. It correctly states the resistivity values for copper (1.7 x 10^-8 Ohm meters) and gold (2.4 x 10^-8 Ohm meters).\n4. The answer seems to imply that gold's higher resistivity (compared to copper) would make it less suitable for use in connectors.\n5. However, the final sentence, \"Is the principle of gold connectors just a marketing hoax?\" is incorrect because gold's resistance is actually lower than copper's due to its higher resistivity (2.4 x 10^-8 Ohm meters vs 1.7 x 10^-8 Ohm meters).\n\nThe correct answer should be: Gold connectors are used because gold's lower conductivity (higher resistivity) helps to reduce signal loss and improve signal quality.","484":"They stay there because the processes that could remove them work very slowly.\n\nThe correct answer should be: They stay there because the processes that could remove them work very slowly is incorrect, and the correct process is: They stay there because the processes that can remove them work very slowly.","485":"The wrong sentence is: \"when you look at the small differences between four or five you can begin track backwards which was the oldest in the banching tree of similarities and differences\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be \"when you look at the small differences between four or five you can begin to track backwards which was the oldest in the branching tree of similarities and differences\".","486":"The sentence with the factual inaccuracy is: \"Besides this, two big hydroelectric power plants, one American and one Canadian, divert water away from the falls to generate electricity.\"\n\nAnalysis: The correct information is that there are hydroelectric power plants located on the American side of the falls (Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant) and the Canadian side (Robertson Power Plant), but there is no mention of another hydroelectric power plant on the Canadian side.","487":"The whole answer contains factually incorrect information. However, the sentence that stands out as the most obviously incorrect is: \"Melatonin is kinda hard to make, and if it isn't used fairly quickly it falls apart.\"\n\nAnalysis: Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, and it is not \"hard to make.\" Its production is actually regulated by the body's internal clock and is influenced by light exposure, but it is not something that \"falls apart\" if not used quickly. Melatonin levels typically rise in response to darkness and decrease with exposure to light, but it does not break down in the way that the sentence suggests.\n\nCorrected whole sentence: Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and is regulated by the body's internal clock and light exposure.","488":"The whole answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nLocal blood vessels (capillaries) do not dilate in response to cellular wastes such as lactic acid, CO2, adenosine (cleaving ATP into ADP yields adenine, which stimulates local vasodilation). The local vessels in that area automatically dilate to bring in more nutrients and get rid of waste.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"cleaving ATP into ADP yields adenine\". This is incorrect, as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) when it is cleaved, not adenine. Adenine is a nitrogenous base found in DNA and RNA, but it is not a product of ATP breakdown.","489":"The correct answer is: \"Something has been put into orbit of a sufficient scale for spacecraft rotating to create artificial gravity to be practical.\"\n\nThe factually incorrect sentence is: \"Something has been put into orbit of a sufficient scale for spacecraft rotating to create artificial gravity to be practical.\"\n\nIn reality, it's actually rotating sections or modules within a space station or spacecraft that create artificial gravity, not an entire object being put into orbit. The rotation of a space station or spacecraft is sufficient to create artificial gravity, but it's not the object itself that's put into orbit.","490":"The wrong sentence is: \"With these cells damaged the acid within the stomach heals the tissue that's now unprotected.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect.

If you treat nitrogen as an ideal gas down to the transition temperature, the lowest speed will be less than 180 m\/s, less than half as fast as at normal temperatures.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The statement \"If you treat nitrogen as an ideal gas down to the transition temperature, the lowest speed will be less than 180 m\/s\" is factually incorrect. The speed of sound in an ideal gas decreases with decreasing temperature, but the statement about the speed being less than 180 m\/s is not a specific or accurate value.\n* The rest of the answer is factually correct: the speed of sound does decrease with decreasing temperature, and the speed of sound in nitrogen (or any gas) can be calculated using the equation c = sqrt(gamma * R * T \/ M), where c is the speed of sound, gamma is the adiabatic index, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and M is the molar mass of the gas.","493":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If he used chemical photographic film, it's either a slight accidental pre- or postexposure during film production or development, again thermal noise, this time in the reaction kinetics of the halogenides or dyes on the film, or, maybe most surprisingly, cosmic rays or beta or gamma radiation.\"\n\nThe correct information about film development is that it's unlikely to show thermal noise from the film itself, as thermal noise is typically associated with digital cameras.

The","495":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\nDepending on where we wish to observe, we always shine a laser and make an *artificial star* near where we want to observe.\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it states that we always shine a laser and make an artificial star near where we want to observe, which is not true. In reality, Adaptive Optics (AO) systems use a laser to illuminate an artificial guide star, but the laser is not necessarily shone near the target star being observed, but rather at a different location in the sky, and the artificial star is not necessarily made near the target star.","496":"The Earth, on the other hand, still has a strong magnetic field from our core, which protects us and our atmosphere from the wrath of the Sun.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong. The Earth's magnetic field is not strong enough to protect our atmosphere from the Sun's solar wind. While the Earth's magnetic field does provide some protection, it is not strong enough to completely shield our atmosphere from the solar wind. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, and it is a major factor in stripping away the atmospheres of planets like Mars.","497":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Light belongs to a class of particles that do not bounce or recoil off one another, they simply pass right through each other.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because light, as a form of electromagnetic radiation, does indeed interact with matter and can bounce off or be absorbed by it, and it also exhibits particle-like behavior in certain experiments, such as the photoelectric effect, where it can transfer energy to particles (like electrons) and cause them to recoil.\n\nThe correct understanding of light is that it can behave both as a wave and a particle, and its behavior depends on the context and the experiment being performed.","498":"The wrong sentence is: \"While the same is true (to a lesser extent) for cats, cat breeders focus on coloring and fur more than size and body shape.\"\n\nThe correct analysis:\n\n- The statement that dogs come in vastly different sizes is factually accurate, as seen with breeds like the teacup dogs and mastiffs.\n- The statement that most house cats are all relatively the same size is also factually accurate, with the exception of larger breeds like the Maine Coon.\n- The statement about a long history of dedicated, purpose-driven selective breeding programs for dogs is accurate, as many breeds have been developed over thousands of years for specific purposes like hunting, herding, or companionship.\n- The statement that cat breeders focus on coloring and fur more than size and body shape is factually incorrect. While cat breeders do focus on coloring and fur, many also prioritize size and body shape, as seen with the development of breeds like the Sphynx, which is known for its sleek, athletic build despite being hairless.","499":"Tadpole shrimps who auto-impregnate reproduce by parthenogenesis, which indeed, produces clones.\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because parthenogenesis is a type of asexual reproduction, not a method of reproduction used by tadpole shrimps that auto-impregnate.","500":"The correct answer without changes is:\n\n Because of the Equivalence Principle(s) in GR, gravitational forces are no different from inertial forces which arise in non-inertial frames. For these inertial forces though, we do not have to introduce an extra force to introduce deviation from linear motion. Gravity, on the other hand, needs to preserve free motion while allowing for linear deviations, so we need to make the theory incorporate the idea of the curvature of spacetime.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The first sentence is factually correct as it explains the Equivalence Principle in GR.\n- The second sentence is also factually correct as it explains the difference between inertial and gravitational forces.\n- The third sentence is factually incorrect. The correct statement is that gravity warps spacetime, but spacetime itself does not tell matter how to move; instead, it is matter and energy that causes spacetime to curve. The correct phrase is 'Matter tells spacetime how to curve'.","501":"The correct answer is: \"more indigo in the colour.\"\n\nThe incorrect sentence is: \"If it ionises the atom by ejecting an electron then there is an emitted photon, so more indigo in the colour.\"\n\nThe correct analysis:\n\n1. The frequency of the re-emitted photon remains the same as the absorbed photon, as per the law of conservation of energy and momentum. This is a fundamental principle in physics.\n\n2. The direction of the re-emitted photon is indeed completely random, as it follows the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n3. If an electron is ejected from an atom due to the absorption of a photon, it is called photoelectric effect, and in this process, a photon with a different frequency (not the same) is emitted, not more indigo in the colour. The colour change is due to the re-emission of a photon of a different frequency, not the emission of more indigo light.","502":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Field of vision is determined by the placement of your eyes (if they were back further on the side of your head, you'd have a larger field of vision, but a smaller area of binocular vision).\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- The statement that the placement of the eyes affects the field of vision is correct. \n- The claim that having the eyes further back on the side of the head would result in a larger field of vision is also correct. \n- The statement that this would result in a smaller area of binocular vision is also correct. \n\nHowever, the statement that having dilated pupils increases the field of vision is incorrect.","503":"The whole sentence without changes is: \"It might not get as much rain or frost.\"","504":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"No matter how hot it gets.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually wrong because it states that as an object gets hotter, the intensity of the radiation decreases for every given frequency. However, in reality, as an object gets hotter, the intensity of the radiation actually increases for all frequencies, including visible light.","505":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Black holes aren't really big, they're just really dense.\"\n\nAnalysis: This sentence is factually incorrect. Black holes can indeed be incredibly massive, with some supermassive black holes having masses millions or even billions of times that of the sun. They are not just \"really dense\" but can have enormous scales.","506":"The whole answer is factually incorrect, but I'll identify the wrong sentence:\n\nThis can cause skin cancer if you're unlucky - or particularly uncareful.\n\nExplanation: \n\n- Skin cancer is a serious health condition that can be caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun, but the sentence implies that it's a rare occurrence due to being \"unlucky\" or \"uncareful\", which is not accurate. Skin cancer is a preventable condition that can be caused by a combination of factors, including prolonged exposure to UV radiation, genetic predisposition, and other environmental factors.","507":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"Experimental searches are ongoing, because its existence would explain something called charge-parity violation which is a big deal in particle physics.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The concept of \"charge-parity violation\" is a real phenomenon in particle physics, but the statement is incorrect in its wording. The correct term is \"charge-parity symmetry violation,\" not \"charge-parity violation.\"","508":"The whole answer is factually wrong, but the sentence that stands out as the most incorrect is:\n\n\"Generally, when you're a kid, if you're outside, you are running around releasing all sorts of adrenaline, which will make you more tired later when it wears off.\"\n\nAdrenaline is actually a hormone that prepares the body for \"fight or flight,\" increasing energy and alertness, not causing fatigue. It's the opposite of making you tired.","509":"The factually wrong sentence in the answer is: \"Background radiation levels vary fairly wildly(200-700mrem) depending on local geology but there is no correlation with cancer rates.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- Background radiation levels do vary due to factors such as altitude, latitude, and local geology, which affect the amount of cosmic radiation and radon exposure. However, the range of 200-700mrem is not entirely accurate. \n- The actual range of background radiation levels in the US is approximately 20-40mrem per year, which is a much lower range than 200mrem.\n- There is some evidence to suggest that there may be a correlation between low-level radiation exposure and an increased risk of cancer, although the evidence is not conclusive and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship.\n\nThe corrected sentence should read: \"Background radiation levels vary due to factors such as altitude, latitude, and local geology, but the actual range of background radiation levels is typically much lower, around 20-40mrem per year.\"","510":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Air travels through and between plant cells in large amounts.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n\n* Plants do absorb air through their leaves, but it's not through lenticles on plant stems.\n* Lenticels are small, raised, and usually not visible on the surface of the stem.\n* They are more commonly found on the surface of leaves, where they allow for gas exchange.\n* The correct mechanism of gas exchange in plants is through stomata (small pores) on the surface of leaves.\n\nThe correct sentence would be: \"Air travels through and between plant cells in small amounts.\"\n\nThe whole sentence without changes: \"Air travels through and between plant cells in small amounts.\"","511":"The answer with the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nThey increase in size.  This is used to often for interference fitting of bearings and other rings.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The statement \"thermal expansion causes the inner diameter to increase\" is generally true for most materials, as they expand when heated and contract when cooled.\n* The use of the bearing is correct, as thermal expansion is often used for interference fitting of bearings and other rings to achieve a secure fit.\n* The statement \"As it cools it will be mated to the surface\" is also correct, as the contraction of the bearing allows it to fit onto a larger shaft.\n\nHowever, the factually wrong sentence is:\n\nThey increase in size.\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because thermal expansion typically causes an increase in diameter, not a decrease. A more accurate sentence would be:\n\nThey decrease in size.\n\nWhen heated, the metal ring expands, and when cooled, it contracts, causing the inner diameter to decrease.","512":"The tails *are* caused by solar winds, but having two stars would *not* cause there to be two tails.","513":"The answer is buoyancy!  It's the same reason a helium balloon in your car gets pushed *forward* when you accelerate and backwards when you brake.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement \"The answer is buoyancy!\" is factually correct.\n- \"It's the same reason a helium balloon in your car gets pushed *forward* when you accelerate and backwards when you brake.\" is factually incorrect. In reality, a helium balloon in a car will experience the same buoyant force in both directions of acceleration (forward and backward), and it will not be pushed forward or backward. The buoyant force acts perpendicular to the direction of acceleration, resulting in the balloon moving along with the car in the direction of acceleration.","514":"The whole answer is wrong.\n\nThe correct answer should be: \n\nIt's not particularly useful for astronomers, who can measure an angle and instantly know for far something is.

In reality, in many cases, sensors in self-driving cars may not have the ability to average across multiple transmissions, as this would require complex and potentially time-consuming processing. While averaging across multiple measurements can help reduce noise and improve accuracy, it's not a universal solution for all sensor systems, especially in real-time applications.","517":"\u03b8 = 1.22 * \u03bb \/ D,","518":"The whole sentence without changes is:\n\nFog is going to get thick enough to drown in.","519":"The classical potential of an idealized harmonic oscillator describes a parabola going to infinity.","520":"The sentence that is factually wrong is: \"Depending on the design of the boat and depth of the rudder, it may be possible to direct the boat with a deep rudder.\"\n\nThe correct analysis is as follows:\n\n- The statement that \"real life currents are always smooth\" is false. Real-life currents can be turbulent and have varying levels of turbulence depending on factors such as depth, location, and surrounding water conditions.\n\n- The statement that \"the energy of the current is constant with depth and location\" is also false. The energy of a current typically decreases with depth due to the decrease in water pressure and increases with location due to the increased velocity of the water.\n\n- The statement about the boat being able to be directed with a deep rudder is generally true, but the conditions under which this is possible are more complex and depend on various factors such as the design of the boat and the specific characteristics of the current.\n\nThe correct sentence would be: \"Depending on the design of the boat and the specific characteristics of the current, it may be possible to direct the boat with a deep rudder.\"","521":"When the power supply is plugged into AC without a phone, it still puts out a constant 5 volts.","522":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong part is: \"It\u2019s essentially Priming the tract to get ready fo food.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"It\u2019s essentially priming the tract to get ready for food.\"","523":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The second is considered much more likely in general.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The sentence states that the second option, where the black hole completely disappears, leaving only particles, is considered much more likely in general. However, in reality, the second option is actually considered much less likely in general. According to the theory of Hawking radiation, it is the first option, where the black hole becomes a stable remnant, that is considered more likely.\n\nCorrected sentence: The second is considered much less likely in general.","524":"The whole sentence with the factually wrong information is: \n\"There is a distinction between Hot and Cold Dark Matter (CDM) based on whether the particles involved are traveling at relativistic or non-relativistic speeds.\"\n\nThe correct information about the distinction between Hot and Cold Dark Matter (CDM) is that there is no such distinction based on the speed of the particles. The distinction is actually based on the temperature of the universe at the time the particles were formed.","525":"The whole answer is factually wrong, but the sentence that stands out as the most incorrect is:\n\n\"The gases being pumped into the atmosphere would not require continuous engineering to maintain.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because creating and maintaining a stable ozone layer around Mars would require continuous engineering and monitoring efforts to ensure the balance of the atmospheric gases and prevent any negative consequences, such as the accumulation of greenhouse gases or the depletion of oxygen. The other sentences in the answer are also incorrect, as creating a stable ozone layer on Mars is not currently technologically possible and would likely require significant scientific breakthroughs and infrastructure development.","526":"The Golden Gate Bridge Study followed folks who had to be physically restrained from jumping off the bridge.
