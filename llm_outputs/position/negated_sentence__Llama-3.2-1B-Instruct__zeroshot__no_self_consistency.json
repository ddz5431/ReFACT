particles and microorganisms and the production is decreased when you're ill).","18":"Malaria resistance is not a great example of an adaptation to a biotic factor; altitude adaptation (Tibet, Andes, etc) is not a great example of adaptation to an abiotic factor.","19":"The populations have not made dozens of spontaneous adaptations to their environment, including the ability to eat citric acid.","20":"Gravity on earth directly influences subatomic processes in the sense that the potential energy of molecular structures is changed, or gravity directly interacts with atoms.","21":"Static

the book.","34":"The ultimate function of this reflex is to increase the amount of surface area on the nipple that is exposed to the cold.","35":"Current projections suggest that another such convergence will not occur for at least 250 million years in our future; that putative future landmass has been definitively named Pangea Ultima, Pangaea Proxima, Neopangaea, or Pangaea II.","36":"In other words squinting does not act like glasses by correcting refractory errors, someone who squints should not be assessed to see if optics will helps their vision.","37":"This slowly cools the

environment.\"\n\nThe original question states that the sensitivity to high frequency sounds is not based on gender, and the answer suggests that age and genetics play a role. However, the correct answer is that the sensitivity to high frequency sounds is actually related to the environment, specifically exposure to loud sounds or noise pollution.","1":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Just a minimally informed individual.\"","2":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"That chemical reaction requires extreme heat to occur.\"\n\nThe correct sentence is: \"The chemical reaction requires a catalyst.\"\n\nThe correct explanation is that the chemical reaction of paper with oxygen in the air is a spontaneous process that occurs without the need for external heat.","3":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"A fragmenting bullet is not lead, it is hard and does not warp before passing through the weave.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, in reality, the main factor that makes a bullet vulnerable to penetration is its high kinetic energy, not its composition. A lead bullet, being a relatively soft and dense material, would likely be stopped by a bulletproof vest, but a steel bullet, being a harder material, would likely be stopped by a bulletproof vest.","4":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Another problem is that you have to use more blades, which increases cost and weight, but also makes flow separation and blade stall less likely, which widens the operating window.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, in the context of jet engines, flow separation and stall are more likely to occur due to the increased pressure differences between the blade and the housing, not the opposite.","5":"Factually correct sentence: \"There are no atoms in the beam - we are performing the experiment one atom at a time.\"\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \n\"there are no atoms in the beam - we are performing the experiment one atom at a time.\"","6":"prosthetic legs would mean less blood and less blood pressure needed, one could assume...","7":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\nAlso, if the universe is infinite in size, wouldn't it cause expansion\/acceleration as well because there's a bigger infinity surrounding any section of the universe?\n\nExplanation:\n- The expansion of space is primarily driven by the energy released by the Big Bang, not by the infinite size of the universe itself.\n- The concept of infinity is a mathematical concept and not a physical one, so it doesn't have a direct impact on the expansion of space.\n- The strength of gravity is what holds objects together, not the infinite size of the universe.\n\nCorrected Answer:\nGravity between sun and other planets is strong enough to hold solar system in place even if space is not expanding.","8":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"It had the (seemingly unusual) property that having a region of space with no Higgs field present takes less energy than it does to have the Higgs field take on a non-zero value.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"It had the property that having a region of space with no Higgs field present takes more energy than it does to have the Higgs field take on a non-zero value.\"\n\nExplanation: The Higgs field is a fundamental concept in the Standard Model of particle physics, and the correct statement is that having a region of space with no Higgs field present would actually require more energy to create, not less. The Higgs field is a necessary component that gives mass to fundamental particles, and it is not possible to have a region of space without it.","9":"Factually incorrect sentence: \"Could I CNC the steel and glue it together with some sort of resin, would that work?\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that \"CNC the steel and glue it together with some sort of resin\" is incorrect because CNC machining (Computer Numerical Control) is a process used to cut or shape metal parts with high precision, but it is not suitable for assembling or bonding materials like resin.\n- The statement that \"would that work\" is also incorrect because even if the materials were suitable for CNC machining, gluing and bonding them together would not be feasible due to the different properties and requirements of the materials involved.\n\nCorrected sentence: Transformer and brushless motor stator cores are made of laminated materials to improve their efficiency and heat dissipation.","10":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"In caves spiders build webs near the exits where light comes in.\"\n\nExplanation: The statement that spiders build webs near the exits of caves is not accurate.

Water is a good conductor of heat, which is why it can absorb and transfer heat from one place to another. However, the statement that water is used in heating systems to melt metal components is incorrect. Water is actually used in cooling systems to absorb heat from the surroundings, not melt metal components.","15":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"This means there needs to be vascularity.\"\n\nVascularity refers to the formation of blood vessels, not the need for blood supply.","16":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"rain drops streaming through their gaseous form.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The correct statement is that raindrops fall from the clouds, not stream through their gaseous form.\n- Clouds are composed of water vapor and other gases, but raindrops are solid particles that fall from the clouds, not gaseous.\n- The process of rain forming is called condensation, not \"streaming through their gaseous form.\"","17":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It usually the respiratory epithelium activity is increased in rest periods (one usually sleeps at night)\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"It usually the respiratory epithelium activity is decreased in rest periods (one usually sleeps at night)\"","18":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Melanin loss predated the agricultural revolution and is due to reduced solar intensity in temperate regions.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Melanin loss is not predated by the agricultural revolution and is due to reduced solar intensity in temperate regions.\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nAside from Alcohol Dehydrogenase, Lactase never 'turning off', and melanin loss after the agricultural revolution I don't know of any changes in humanity that have been caused by environmental factors. Are there others?\n\nThe correct sentence is factual, as the loss of melanin is not directly linked to the agricultural revolution and is not caused by environmental factors.","19":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's tracked the same 12 cultures of bacteria evolving continuously for 25 years.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the bacteria have made dozens of spontaneous adaptations to their environment, which is not mentioned in the provided answer. The correct statement is that Lenski's Long Term E.coli Evolution Experiment has tracked the same 12 cultures of bacteria evolving continuously for 25 years, but the specific details of their adaptations are not provided.","20":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"or gravity directly interacts with atoms.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"or gravity directly affects the atoms.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The statement \"gravity directly interacts with atoms\" is incorrect because gravity does not directly interact with individual atoms. Gravity affects the overall structure of molecules and the distribution of molecules, but it does not directly affect individual atoms.\n* The statement \"or gravity directly affects the atoms\" is also incorrect because it implies that gravity directly interacts with individual atoms, which is not the case.","21":"Static charges accumulate less easily in dry air and the air on board a flying plane has a considerably higher humidity than what you would normally see on the ground.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is the last one. The correct statement is that static charges accumulate less easily in dry air, not higher. This is because dry air contains few ions, which are essential for static electricity to form. Dry air is also more likely to have a higher humidity, which can actually reduce the formation of static electricity.","22":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"A larger area of contact between two surfaces would create a larger source of frictional forces, it also reduces the pressure between the two surfaces for a given force holding them together.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the correct relationship between friction and area is that the frictional force is directly proportional to the area of contact, not inversely proportional to it.","23":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Scientists are making small things appear and disappear but for an invisibility cloak which is seen in Harry Potter\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Scientists are making small objects appear and disappear\"\n\nCorrected sentence: \"Scientists are making small objects appear and disappear\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The sentence is correct in stating that scientists are working on creating invisibility cloaks.\n- The sentence is correct in stating that invisibility cloaks are seen in the Harry Potter series.\n- The sentence is correct in stating that the Army are developing invisibility technology.","24":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Resistance of Fresh water 0.055 \u00b5S\/cm at 25 \u00b0C.\"\n\nHere's the corrected answer:\n\nThe correct answer is: \n* Resistance of Fresh water 1000 ohm cm at 25 \u00b0C.\n* An average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of 30,000 amperes (30 kA), and transfers 15 coulombs of electric charge and 350 megajoules of energy.\n* Large bolts of lightning cannot carry up to 120 kA and 350 coulombs.\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct formula to calculate the voltage required to kill a person is V = I x R, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. Since the resistance of water is approximately 1000 ohm cm at 25 \u00b0C, we can calculate the voltage required to kill a person as V = 30 kA x 1000 ohm cm = 30,000 volts.","25":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If they were different what does this actually mean?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"If they were different, what would be the consequence of this difference?\"\n\nThis is because the question is asking about the meaning of the difference, not the effect it would have on the behavior of the stars in other galaxies.","26":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"During starvation, there is no more food reaching that far.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"During starvation, there is no food reaching that far\" or \"During starvation, food is not being consumed that far\".\n\nThe reason is that the statement \"there is no food reaching that far\" is incorrect. In reality, the stomach and small intestine continue to function and digest food even during starvation, but the lack of food means that the gut flora cannot produce any new bacteria to replace the ones that have died off.","27":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Why does it not appear sometimes?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Why does the sun create a straight line of light over a body of water?\"","28":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"In addition, if travel is less restricted, community transmission will cease to be a risk.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"In addition, if travel is more restricted, community transmission will cease to be a risk.\"","29":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"This is not the scale factor plotted against cosmological time, based on observational data.\"\n\nCorrected answer:\nThe factually correct sentence is:\n\"This is the scale factor plotted against cosmological time, based on observational data.\"","30":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If not, where did these stereotypes come from?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"If not, where did these stereotypes come from?\"","31":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It's the H+ that does the work of corroding metals and reacting as an acid.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that the presence of H+ is the cause of corrosion, which is incorrect. Corrosion is actually caused by the release of H+ ions, which reacts with the metal to form an acid (H+ and HSO4-).","32":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If the human body beaks fat down into water and salt, does drinking more water prohibit or inhibit the breakdown of fat?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"If the human body breaks down fat into water and salt, does drinking more water inhibit the breakdown of fat?\"\n\nThe correct sentence is factually accurate, as the breakdown of fat into water and salt is a natural process in the body, but the impact of drinking water on this process is not directly related to the amount of water consumed.","33":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"You know when you are riding in a car on a road trip and you decide to read that book- then you are really car sick after like 1 paragraph?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"You know when you are riding in a car on a road trip and you decide to read that book.\"\n\nThis sentence is the correct statement of the question, and the factually wrong sentence is the one that was changed.","34":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The ultimate function of this reflex is to increase the amount of surface area on the nipple that is exposed to the cold.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement is correct. The skin reflex, also known as the thermoregulatory response, is a natural mechanism that helps maintain body temperature.\n- However, the factually correct statement should be: \"The ultimate function of this reflex is to increase blood flow to the skin, not surface area.\"\n- The skin's surface area is not directly related to the function of the thermoregulatory response in this context.\n- The statement about \"homestasis\" is also incorrect, as homestasis refers to the process of maintaining a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions, such as temperature.\n- The statement about \"geesebumps\" is also incorrect, as goosebumps are actually small, raised bumps on the skin caused by increased blood flow, not the result of a thermoregulatory response.","35":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There are other massive continental convergences *per se*\"\n\nThe word \"per se\" is an adverb that means \"by itself\" or \"in itself\". It is not a preposition that indicates the relationship between the phrase \"other massive continental convergences\".","36":"Factually wrong sentence: \"someone who squints should not be assessed to see if optics will helps their vision.\"\n\nCorrected answer: Squinting helps eliminate non-straight light rays entering the eye, this means the need for refracting or focusing of light which is non-straight is reduced.","37":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The power - the current in the motor pushing against this voltage - is what turns the motor.\"\n\nCorrected answer:","38":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"The energy requirement of the warm food is the same, regardless of what's in the fridge, but a full fridge allows less warm air to be exchanged.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the energy requirement of the warm food actually increases when the fridge is full, not decreases.","39":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"As far as I know though, the production of spiders whose venom transforms the human body in an intentional way is...\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\n\"As far as I know, the production of spiders whose venom transforms the human body in an intentional way is at least 5 to 10 years away.\"\n\nThe correct fact is that there is no scientific evidence of a spider venom that can transform a human body intentionally.","40":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"In Prokaryotic cells, every cell can work together making proteins for the organism.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that all prokaryotic cells work together to make proteins for the organism, which is not true. Prokaryotic cells, like all cells, do not have the ability to work together to produce proteins, but rather they produce proteins individually.","41":"Factually wrong sentence: \"A rough estimate is that most laser tech humanity currently has \/ could build, would have a functional maximum range of our own solar system.\"\n\nThe factually incorrect part is: \"our own solar system.\"","42":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"it will decay to ~~C^(12)~~ N^(14)\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\nit will decay to C^(12)","43":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There are no air, water or other molecules adsorbed to the surfaces of your crystals.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct answer should have mentioned that the ions in the salt crystal lattice are not perfectly aligned at the molecular level, not that there are no adsorbed molecules on the surface.","44":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"hydroxydione is a steroid molecule, way bigger than a glucose\"\n\nThe correct answer is: \"hydroxydione is a steroid molecule, and it is a common intermediate in glycolysis.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"hydroxydione is a common intermediate in glycolysis.\"\n\nHere is the corrected answer without changes:\n\nI wonder if there is a translation error - the carboxylic acid is removed from the end of the 3-phosphoglycerate, where the phosphate was removed.","45":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"I can see winter droughts not allowing underbrush such as grasses to grow which may alleviate wildfire conditions.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that winter droughts allow underbrush to grow, which is the opposite of what typically occurs. In a drought, underbrush is often sparse and dry, increasing the risk of wildfires.","46":"Here is the factually correct answer:\n\nThe correct answer is: It takes a lot of bots or people all attacking at the same time to be effective.\n\nThe factually correct sentence is: It takes even more if your site has a robust network able to handle something like that.\n\nThe correct sentence is factually correct because a robust network can handle a large number of attacks, but it's not necessarily about having a lot of bandwidth.","47":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"With these calculations, it is possible to determine the orbitals' size and shape to then determine the \"exact\" distance\/angle (theoretical\/average) of one nucleus relative to another of the same molecule.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"With these calculations, it is possible to determine the orbitals' size and shape to then determine the exact distance\/angle of one nucleus relative to another of the same molecule.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"With these calculations, it is possible to determine the orbitals' size and shape to then determine the exact distance\/angle of one nucleus relative to another of the same molecule.\"","48":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's common to see people attain indicators of adulthood around their mid to late twenties or early thirties.\"\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the typical age range for attaining indicators of adulthood is actually around 20-25 years old, not 30s.","49":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"How is this possible?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"How does this work?\"","50":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Perhaps some animals do but we usually label it territorial, self preservation, mating reasons, or preserving it's gene pool.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Perhaps some animals do bully which sometimes ends in death or murder.\"","51":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Indeed, it's nothing if it was just put into your room.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the amount of energy from the sun's power output in joules per second is enormous, far beyond the energy needed to heat a half cup of water by 1 degree.","52":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"In the United States, we're still on a 'once-through' fuel cycle, which means that we don't reprocess or reuse any fuel.\"\n\nCorrected sentence: \"In the United States, we're still on a 'once-through' fuel cycle, which means that we're still on a 'once-through' fuel cycle.\"","53":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"It is not necessary for an object orbiting a comet to be moving slowly relative to the comet, and the comet's velocity relative to other celestial bodies does affect its ability to hold the satellite in orbit.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"It is not necessary for an object orbiting a comet to be moving slowly relative to the comet, and the comet's velocity relative to other celestial bodies does affect its ability to hold the satellite in orbit.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence is: \"It is not necessary for an object orbiting a comet to be moving slowly relative to the comet, and the comet's velocity relative to other celestial bodies does affect its ability to hold the satellite in orbit.\"","54":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"at the equator, the Earth is not rotating about 1000 mph (circumference is roughly 24,000 miles, 24 time zones).\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the Earth's rotation speed at the equator is approximately 1,674 km\/h (1,040 mph), not 1000 mph.","55":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"And while I won't speak of flavor in the conventional sense, relative pH levels could change how the proteins within the dough behave to change texture.\"\n\nThe sentence is incorrect because it implies that relative pH levels can change the texture of the dough, which is not a scientifically proven fact. The pH level of dough is more closely related to the type of flour used, the temperature, and the type of salt used, rather than the water source.","56":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Can we smash Hydrogen and Helium together to make Lithium?\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The statement that \"Hydrogen and Helium can be smashed together to make Lithium\" is incorrect because Lithium is an element, not a compound. Lithium is a chemical element with the atomic number 3. Hydrogen and Helium are two separate elements with atomic numbers 1 and 2, respectively.\n* The statement also implies that \"nuclear reactions\" are involved, which is incorrect. Nuclear reactions involve changes to the nucleus of an atom, not the combination of atoms.","57":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Even Pando is still more or less identical to modern day aspens although mostly inconsequential mutations were used in part to estimate its age.\"","58":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"That's just a hunch taken from my 1 year of anatomy and physiology.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"That's just a hunch taken from my 1 year of anatomy and physiology.\"","59":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's a fundamental feature of spacetime: I like to describe it by saying that inside a black hole, space and time switch places.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that space and time can switch places, which contradicts the fundamental concept of spacetime as a four-dimensional fabric that is curved by the presence of mass and energy, and is not something that can be switched or switched places like a book or a chair.","60":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"For a big tree, that means quite a lot.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that a big tree produces a large amount of oxygen, which contradicts the fact that plants respire and produce Carbon Dioxide, not Oxygen.","61":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"these duplicates exist, but finding the collisions is extremely hard.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, according to the pigeonhole principle, if there are many inputs (duplicates) and a limited number of outputs (collisions), it is indeed possible to find a collision, as the number of possible inputs is much, much, much larger than the number of unique outputs.","62":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Hot saturated solution of sodium hydroxide can reach pH = 16.\"\n\nThis is incorrect because the pH of a hot saturated solution of sodium hydroxide is actually around 10, not 16.","63":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The main function of liver is to remove ingested toxins from blood before they reach main circulation, and liver cells are relatively often killed off in that process.\"\n\nCorrected Answer: The main function of liver is to filter blood and remove waste products, toxins, and excess substances from the blood before they enter the liver's digestive system.","64":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"it's called the wiedemann-franz law.\"\n\nThe correct answer is: \"it's called the wiedemann-franz law.\"","65":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"You don't need to collide two planets to compress water.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that compressing water requires colliding two planets, which is not a real scenario. The correct sentence should be: \"You don't need to collide two planets to compress water.\"\n\nThe rest of the answer is correct, so the corrected sentence remains the same:","66":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"So yes, you are seeing photons, but explaining it that way is about as good as saying that you're seeing light.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the explanation of fire as a process of photons is equivalent to explaining the process of photosynthesis, which is not accurate. The process of photosynthesis is a complex biological process that involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, whereas fire is a chemical reaction involving the combustion of fuel, not the conversion of light energy.","67":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"You would likely feel an attenuated shock every time the fence is powered because your body acts like a capacitor and it takes a little current to charge you up to the same voltage as the wires.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"You would likely feel an attenuated shock every time the fence is powered because your body acts like a capacitor and it takes a little current to charge you up to the same voltage as the wires.\"","68":"Factually wrong sentence: \n\"presumably to sleep\"","69":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"with the outermost shells mimicking being stable, the material is more likely to accept and transfer electrons.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the outermost shells of atoms are actually the inner shells, not the outermost shells. The outermost shells are the inner shells, and they are the ones that are stable and resist changes in their electron configuration.","70":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Not friction from the water obviously.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Not friction from the water obviously prevents light from penetrating the water.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe reason light fails to penetrate deep into water is not because of friction from the water, but because water is a poor conductor of electricity and heat. When light travels through water, it encounters resistance due to the movement of water molecules, which slows down the light. This resistance is known as refraction, and it is responsible for the bending of light as it passes through the water.","71":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"hydrogen sulphide for example has a near 109.5 degree bond angle compared to the roughly tetrahedral water.\"\n\nCorrected sentence: \nThe factually correct sentence is: \"Transition metals also form compounds without valence bonds: platinum for example forms covalent square planar complexes\"","72":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Neuron connections are the cause or the consequence of learning?\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because neurons do not cause or result from learning. Learning is a process that occurs in the brain, and it involves the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections based on experience, but neurons themselves do not cause learning.","73":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"I do not believe that cellular activity produces sound in any sort of meaningful way.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because cellular activity, such as division, osmosis, and other cellular processes, do indeed produce sound waves through the movement of molecules and the rupture of cell membranes, which can be perceived as noise.","74":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It is clear that errors could be eliminated by boosting signal\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the actual effect of boosting signal is to reduce the amplitude of the signal, not eliminate errors.","75":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's alive.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because potatoes are inanimate objects, not living organisms. They are a type of root vegetable, and their \"starchy substance\" is a carbohydrate called starch, which is a non-living compound used for energy storage and structural purposes in plants.","76":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Most people have less than 3 different types of cone cells, and these do not have 3 different response curves.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\nMost people have 3 different types of cone cells, and these do have 3 different response curves.","77":"The factually incorrect sentence is: \"The energy that is released does not come from energy that was spent to form the explosive, combustable compound in the first place.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"The energy that is released comes from the energy that was spent to form the explosive, combustable compound in the first place.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct explanation of an explosion is that energy is released when the bonds in the compound are broken and the atoms split up and bond with other atoms, which is known as chemical reaction. The energy that was spent to form the compound in the first place is used to break the bonds in the compound, resulting in the release of energy.","78":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n&gt; \"some doctors would inject bacteria directly into the tumor and it was very effective.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n&gt; \"some doctors would inject bacteria into the tumor and it was very effective.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct statement is that in the 19th century, doctors would inject bacteria directly into the tumor, but this was not very effective, as it often led to severe infections and even death.","79":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"They are not very efficient animals, and cannot go a while without food if they require it.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because spiders are not known to require food in the same way that animals do. They are carnivores, but their diet consists mainly of insects, which are readily available in their environment.","80":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"There weren't any atoms.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it contradicts the established scientific fact that atoms were present in the universe before the Big Bang. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe began as a singularity, and atoms were formed from the energy released during this event.","81":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Does the Sun have a similar 'bulge' because of its rotation (or perhaps because of the pull of all the planets being along one plane)\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the Sun's rotation is not the primary cause of its equatorial bulge, but rather the stronger gravity and slower rotation rate. The Sun's equatorial bulge is caused by the centrifugal force due to its rotation.","82":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"slapchopped his head off.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be \"slapped him off.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Nervous system insects have does not have one central organ, but is built from series of ganglions, located along whole body. When an insect loses its head it loses most of its nervous system, but most of the organs that allow it to survive in the long run are still intact, and it'll probably live a long life.\"","83":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"the claimed range of 109 miles\"","84":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\n\"It seems like this should take more than just a few seconds to start the supernova.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that the fusing of iron causes a supernova to start in a short period of time, which contradicts the known fact that a supernova occurs when a star runs out of fuel and collapses under gravity, which takes a significant amount of time.","85":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"There are other decay modes which will compete with alpha decay on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"There are other decay modes which will compete with alpha decay.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct sentence is factually correct. Alpha decay is indeed a mode of radioactive decay where an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle (helium nucleus) to become a more stable nucleus. This process is indeed competitive with other decay modes, such as beta decay, where a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, or gamma decay, where energy is released as gamma radiation.\n\nHowever, the factually correct sentence implies that all heavy nuclei will be able to undergo alpha decay, which is not entirely accurate. While it is true that many heavy nuclei can undergo alpha decay, not all of them will, and the competition with other decay modes depends on the specific nucleus.","86":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"How long someone is infected and contagious before symptoms appear, since once symptoms appear people (should be) staying home relatively isolated.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \n\"How long someone is infected and contagious before symptoms appear, since once symptoms appear, people (should) stay home relatively isolated.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the correct statement is that the incubation period is the time between exposure to a virus and the onset of symptoms, not that people should stay home relatively isolated after symptoms appear.","87":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Carbohydrates are fully digested in the stomach through the enzymatic action of alpha-Amylase.\"\n\nThe correct statement is that carbohydrates are partially digested in the small intestine, not the stomach.","88":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If any other organism (including *you*!) produces a protein with similar structure to the one you are allergic to then you will not have an allergic response when exposed to it.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the presence of the allergen in another organism is a guarantee against an allergic reaction, which is not true. In reality, the presence of the allergen in another organism can still trigger an allergic response, even if the individual is not allergic to it.","89":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Think of times you've had a stuffy nose and just couldn't smell at all, even though it seemed like you could still breathe some through your nose anyway.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Think of times you've had a stuffy nose and you couldn't smell anything, even though it seemed like you could still breathe through your nose.\"","90":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It does have a well-defined length, area, or volume.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"It does have a well-defined mass, event horizon size, and spin.\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\nThe singularity of a black hole is not a point or set of points in the spacetime manifold.","91":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"At each of these 5 points, and at some others, the gravitational forces of the two bodies perfectly balance the centrifugal force of the rotating reference frame.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- There are 5 Lagrange points, not 5 solutions, as the correct number is 5. \n- There are 5 Lagrange points because there are 5 solutions to the problem of where acceleration is 0 in the 2 body problem in a rotating reference frame. \n- The correct statement is: \"There are 5 Lagrange points because there are 5 solutions to the problem of where acceleration is 0 in the 2 body problem in a rotating reference frame.\"\n- The other sentence is correct, as it accurately describes the location of the Lagrange points.","92":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If a photon is absorbed by an electron in an atom (or by rotational\/vibrational modes in a molecule), the photon or photons emitted when it drops back down the energy levels aren't emitted in the same direction.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"If a photon is absorbed by an electron in an atom (or by rotational\/vibrational modes in a molecule), the photon or photons emitted when it drops back down the energy levels are emitted in the same direction.\"","93":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Measure the position of a star, then measure it again six months later when the Earth has moved 100 million km, and use the change in angle to calculate distance.\"\n\nThe correct calculation to calculate distance is based on the principle of parallax, not the change in angle. The correct formula is:\n\nd = 2 * (distance in parsecs) * (1 \/ (1 + B)cos(\u03b8))\n\nWhere d is the distance in parsecs, B is the brightness of the object, and \u03b8 is the angle of parallax.\n\nThe factually correct sentence is:\n\n\"Measure the position of a star, then measure it again in a different location and compare the brightness of the star in that location to its brightness in a different location to calculate distance.\"","94":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If you pull your butthole\"\n\nThis sentence implies that the anus is a muscle that can be strained, which is not the case. The anus is a natural, non-muscular structure that does not have the ability to contract or strain like muscles do. The correct answer should have stated that the external anal sphincter is the muscle that surrounds the anus and is responsible for controlling its opening and closing.","95":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If not, seems planets would \"evaporate\" over a millions of years, rather than sticking around.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that planets would evaporate over millions of years, which is a process that occurs through the loss of atmospheric gases to space, not due to the hydrogen escaping its gravity.","96":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"When hydrogen fuses into helium in the core of the Sun, the total mass of the products is greater than the mass of the hydrogen atoms that you started with, due to nuclear effects.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the Sun does not fuse hydrogen into helium in its core. Hydrogen fuses into helium in the Sun's core through nuclear fusion reactions, but these reactions occur at temperatures and pressures that are so high that the hydrogen nuclei are fused into helium nuclei, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.","97":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"In the same way, particle accelerators generate extremely high temperatures in very very tiny bits of matter, so the amount of heat released is small and easily managed.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because particle accelerators generate extremely high temperatures, not tiny bits of matter. Particle accelerators accelerate subatomic particles to nearly the speed of light, which produces temperatures that are far beyond what is typically considered \"tiny bits of matter\".","98":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Within a few centimeters of air, most of it has not dissipated.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because alpha radiation is highly penetrating and can travel far beyond a few centimeters into air, causing significant damage to living tissues.","99":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It is thought disruption of this labelling may cause auditory hallucinations in some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because auditory hallucinations are a type of sensory experience that occurs when a person perceives sounds or other sensory information that is not actually present in their environment. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, but it is not caused by the disruption of labelling (or perception) in the brain.","100":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Your body's primary response when it gets infected or irritated is usually to cause inflammation in that area.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because inflammation is actually a response to injury or damage, not infection. When the body is injured or damaged, it responds by increasing blood flow and releasing chemicals to repair the damage, which leads to inflammation. Infection typically triggers a different response, including the activation of immune cells and the release of chemical signals that attract white blood cells to the affected area.","101":"Factually wrong sentence: \"That is of course unless it was sending out rf signals of some kind trying to be found.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"That is of course unless it was sending out radio signals of some kind trying to be found.\"","102":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's easy to enumerate them, and just as easy to design drugs for each of them individually.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that there are many targets of a tumor suppressor protein, which is not necessarily true. Tumor suppressor proteins often have multiple targets, but the specific targets can vary widely among different proteins.","103":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"One of the displaced remnants of the vortex was pulled South by a large low pressure system and boom, now we have this.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that the polar vortex has become unstable and broken apart, and then somehow magically reassembled itself southward, with the help of a low-pressure system. This is not a natural occurrence, as the polar vortex is a complex system that is influenced by atmospheric conditions, not just a simple reassembly.","104":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"More surface area would hinder the enzymes in the digestive tract from breaking down the food more quickly.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because blending a meal does not affect the surface area of the digestive tract, it actually increases the surface area by breaking down the food into smaller particles, allowing for better digestion.","105":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"There is not a scientific consensus (or enough research thus far) to conclude that antibodies will protect a person in the long term.\"\n\nCorrected Answer: There is not a scientific consensus (or enough research thus far) to conclude that antibodies will protect a person in the long term.","106":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Does it take time for all the bacteria to die that are exposed to the soap or gel?\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: \"Does it take time for the bacteria to die that are exposed to the soap or gel?\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct sentence should be \"Does it take time for the bacteria to die that are exposed to the soap or gel?\" \nThe factually correct sentence should be \"Does it take time for the bacteria to die that are exposed to the soap or gel?\"","107":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"There would be approximately the same ammount of petroleum products in the earth.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"There would be approximately the same amount of petroleum products in the earth.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe amount of petroleum products in the earth would have remained the same, but the quality and availability of petroleum products would have been different due to the absence of coal and natural gas from the Cambrian period.","108":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"If it is off, then the lens is not adjusted accordingly.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \n\"If it is off, then the lens is adjusted accordingly.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe human eye does not have a sensor that detects contrast in a portion of the frame, but rather the light entering the eye is detected by the retina. The retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors (rods and cones) that convert light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain. The brain interprets these signals to determine the presence or absence of light, and adjusts the focus accordingly.\n\nThe eye does not have a \"camera\" that detects light, but rather the light that enters the eye is detected by the retina. The retina sends electrical signals to the brain, which interprets the signals to determine the presence or absence of light, and adjusts the focus accordingly.","109":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Snoozing your alarm prevents you from entering the first portion of a sleep cycle and allows you to wake up naturally.\"\n\nThe correct sentence would be:\n\"Snoozing your alarm prevents you from entering the second portion of a sleep cycle and allows you to wake up in the middle of the night.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the first sleep cycle typically lasts around 90-120 minutes, and snoozing the alarm would disrupt the normal sleep-wake cycle, leading to a longer sleep period.","110":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"that could have no consequences for all sorts of life on earth that rely on the moon for both tidal patterns and light etc.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"That could have no consequences for all sorts of life on earth that rely on the moon for tidal patterns and gravitational forces.\"\n\nThe correct sentence is factually accurate because the moon's gravitational forces play a crucial role in stabilizing Earth's axis and maintaining our planet's tilt, which is essential for maintaining seasonal patterns and the water cycle.","111":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Genes are not linked to the expression of left-handedness.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: \"Genes are linked to the expression of left-handedness.\"\n\nExplanation: The statement that genes are not linked to the expression of left-handedness is incorrect. Research has shown that genetic factors do play a role in determining handedness, and there is a significant correlation between genetic predisposition and handedness.","112":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"To be a little pedantic, any electron involved in a chemical bond is not by definition a valence electron, so in that sense your question does make sense - you can have a non-valence electron in a bond.\"\n\nCorrected answer: \nThe factually correct sentence is:\n\"In that sense, your question does make sense - you can have a non-valence electron in a bond.\"","113":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Everything else is too far away for any interaction to happen.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that all matter and energy are too far away to interact with us, which is not true. In fact, according to our current understanding of physics, all matter and energy are part of the observable universe, and interactions can occur between objects within it.","114":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Because MSL also acts as the standard datum for nautical and topographic mapping, everything is much neater using this as a standard (although, let's face it, simplicity rarely comes into these things).\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Because MSL also acts as the standard datum for nautical and topographic mapping, everything is much neater using this standard.\"","115":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"No terrestrial planets have a molten core and mantle to some degree, nor do the larger moons.\"\n\nCorrected sentence: \n\"No terrestrial planets have a molten core and mantle to some degree, nor do the larger moons.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe sentence incorrectly states that \"terrestrial planets\" have a molten core and mantle, which is incorrect. The correct statement should be that \"terrestrial planets\" have a solid core and mantle. Terrestrial planets are typically rocky planets with solid surfaces and no significant molten cores.","116":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If you can eliminate off-axis, or non-incident light, you get a fairly clear image without having to change the optics (i.e. don't need your glasses as much).\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"If you can eliminate off-axis, or non-incident light, you get a fairly clear image without having to change the optics, or the glasses as much.\"","117":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Influenza has a low rate of mutation, which means the prevalent strains circulating in a given season have not changed enough for your immune system to not recognize them.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Influenza has a high rate of mutation, which means the prevalent strains circulating in a given season have changed enough for your immune system to not recognize them.\"","118":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"You cannot get the equations of motion straight from the Hamiltonian.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"You can get the equations of motion straight from the Hamiltonian.\"","119":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"By adding one or more layers of material at the interface, the impedance can be matched over a specified wavelength range such that the back-reflection can be well below 4%.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because adding layers of material at the interface does not directly address the mechanism behind optical Fresnel losses. Fresnel losses occur due to the change in refractive index between the air and the material, not the addition of layers of material.","120":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Because there is no definite up or down in space, there is also no clockwise or counterclockwise.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because in the context of the Earth's rotation, the direction of \"up\" is considered to be towards the North Pole, not the South Pole.","121":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Metallic hydrogen is definitely not theoretical and does not possibly exist inside of gas giants like Jupiter.\"","122":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If you are changing the aircraft pitch, conceivably you could have different acceleration values, but I doubt it is a large difference.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"If you are changing the aircraft pitch, you could have different acceleration values.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe reason for the difference in G-forces experienced by the pilot in the back seat and the copilot is due to the difference in their positions relative to the aircraft's center of lift. The copilot is typically closer to the center of lift, which means they experience a greater force, or G-force, due to the aircraft's lift.","123":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"In the prefrontal cortex, the relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum (which drives exploratory and sensation seeking behavior) is imbalanced, leading to a lack of inhibitory control.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"In the prefrontal cortex, the relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum is imbalanced, leading to a lack of inhibitory control.\"\n\nThe correct sentence describes the effect of the prefrontal cortex on the ventral striatum, which is the opposite of what the sentence describes. The prefrontal cortex actually enhances the ventral striatum's ability to regulate impulses, whereas the sentence suggests that the prefrontal cortex hinders it.","124":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Char and lake trout who feed off the larvae and nymphs would loose their main food source.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Char and lake trout who feed on the eggs of the mosquitoes would lose their main food source.\"","125":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"That the quantum world actually is probabilistic.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"That the quantum world actually is deterministic.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement that the quantum world is probabilistic is incorrect. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, states that it is impossible to know certain properties of a particle, such as its position and momentum, simultaneously with infinite precision. This is a deterministic principle, not a probabilistic one.","126":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"However, this appears to be false.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the statement \"this appears to be false\" is a rhetorical device used to make the statement more convincing or persuasive. It is not a factual claim that can be verified or disproven.","127":"Factually wrong sentence: \"Not any that you could hear if you were hanging out there in a spacesuit, but even in sparser regions of the interstellar medium especially energetic events like supernovae can create shockwaves that propagate for many light-years.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence should be: \"Not any that you could hear if you were hanging out there in a spacesuit, but even in sparser regions of the interstellar medium especially energetic events like supernovae can create shockwaves that propagate for many light-years.\"","128":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"They have been dealing with FIV for a long time, somewhere in the 10's of millions of years.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because:\n\n* FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) is a viral disease that affects cats, not humans.\n* The statement \"a long time\" is also incorrect, as FIV is known to have been present in cats for thousands of years, not millions of years.","129":"The factually incorrect sentence is: \"Not just because they are huge but because their operation relies on incredible precision.\"\n\nThe reason for this sentence is that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is an extremely complex machine, but its operation is not solely based on precision. The LHC's operation relies on a delicate balance of magnetic fields, detectors, and other technological systems to collect and analyze data from collisions of subatomic particles. While precision is crucial in the LHC's operation, it is not the sole factor that drives its design.","130":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Various groups like COOH, COH, OH affect the behaviour and composition.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Various groups like COOH, COH, OH affect the chemical properties and composition.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence should be analyzed as follows:\n\n* The sentence states that the behavior of the chemical is unpredictable, which is correct.\n* It mentions that a decent scientist should be able to make educated assumptions, which is correct.\n* It mentions that the chemical behavior is predictable, which is also correct.\n* However, the sentence incorrectly states that the chemical's behavior is affected by the presence of these groups, which is incorrect. The chemical's behavior is affected by its chemical properties and composition, not just the presence of these groups.","131":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The one valence electron is farther and farther from the nucleus, meaning there's a weaker electrostatic hold on it and the atom can ionize more easily.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"The one valence electron is farther from the nucleus, meaning there's a weaker electrostatic hold on it and the atom is less reactive.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The correct statement is that as you move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius increases due to the increasing effective nuclear charge, which increases the electrostatic hold on the valence electrons. This makes the atom more reactive.\n* However, the answer given mentions that the valence electron is farther from the nucleus, which is incorrect. The correct statement should be that the valence electron is farther from the nucleus, not the atom itself.","132":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"sunlight is causing a chemical reaction in the reservoir that is unsafe for drinking.\"\n\nThe correct statement is that the reservoir is not being covered with a chemical reaction that is unsafe for drinking.","133":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"So, you don't actually observe the astronaut crossing the event horizon.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"So, you would actually observe the astronaut crossing the event horizon.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that, according to general relativity, the astronaut would indeed cross the event horizon, but from their perspective, they would not be able to observe it because the point of no return, where the curvature of spacetime becomes so strong that not even light can escape, is located at the center of the black hole.","134":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"For most of its life it exists as a multicellular organism, but when conditions turn unfavorable, the cells separate to form single-celled amoeboids.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"For most of its life it exists as a multicellular organism, but when conditions turn unfavorable, the cells undergo a process called budding, not amoeboids.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The sentence is correct, as the correct process of how single-celled organisms can evolve into multi-celled organisms is through a process called budding, not amoeboids.\n* The factually correct process of budding is a type of asexual reproduction in which a single cell divides into two daughter cells, each of which becomes a new individual.","135":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Let that sit in your mouth for a while and you have a breeding ground for bacteria ruining your teeth.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the concept of \"breeding ground\" implies that the bacteria in the mouth are actively reproducing, which is not accurate. The correct statement would be \"Let that sit in your mouth for a while and you may have a breeding ground for bacteria to multiply and cause tooth decay.\"","136":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's a similar relation to ashes and a fire.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the relation between ashes and a fire is not directly applicable to stars. The correct relation is that ashes are what kill a fire, not stars.","137":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There's actually animals for whom it's completely normal and healthy to be nearsighted. Example: mice.\"\n\nThe statement that mice can climb and jump extremely well, and that their depth perception is great enough to judge distances without needing glasses, is factually incorrect. While mice are agile and nimble animals, their eyes are not capable of judging distances in the same way as humans. Mice have a different visual system that is adapted for detecting movement and spatial awareness within their immediate environment, not for judging distances.","138":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's more important for survival that you can notice something novel rather than wasting time noticing something that is always there and therefore probably not a threat to you.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the brain prioritizes noticing new stimuli over existing ones, which is not true. The brain's ability to habituate to a stimulus is a natural process that helps us adjust to new or familiar stimuli, and it's not necessarily about prioritizing new stimuli over existing ones.","139":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It looks like this question popped up before, but wasn't really answered.\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n\"If you're drinking a cold beverage on a hot day to cool down, it is actually better than drinking a hot beverage in order to cool down.\"","140":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"There are two kinds of carbon that occur in large amounts C-12 and C-14.\"\n\nThe correct answer is that there are two kinds of carbon that occur in large amounts: C-12 and C-13.","141":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Once the wind speed drops to around 7 mph and they do not need a starter motor to get going.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because wind turbines do not need a motor to start spinning in the first place, they are already spinning when they are installed. The correct answer should be:\n\"Once the wind speed drops to about 7 mph, the turbine is already spinning and does not need a motor to get going.\"","142":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Lungs have fewer blood vessels and alveoli on the posterior surfaces.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Lungs have fewer blood vessels and alveoli on the anterior surfaces.\"\n\nThe reason for laying patients on their stomachs on an ICU ward is to increase oxygen absorption through the lungs.","143":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"There are quite a lot of open space around the Local Group with very few \"field\" galaxies\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"There are a lot of open space around the Local Group with very few galaxies.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- \"Field\" is a word that refers to a region of space with no stars, planets, or other objects. In this context, it doesn't make sense to talk about \"field\" galaxies, as galaxies are massive objects that contain stars, gas, and dust.\n- The term \"field galaxies\" is not a commonly used term in astronomy.\n- The phrase \"open space\" is a more accurate description of the vast, empty regions around the Local Group, which is a galaxy cluster that contains several smaller galaxies, including the Milky Way and Andromeda.","144":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"squidgy\".","145":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Inbreeding makes the passing on of deleterious genes more likely, not a certainty.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Inbreeding makes the passing on of deleterious genes less likely, not a certainty.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nInbreeding can indeed lead to an increased risk of passing on deleterious genes to offspring, as it can result in a loss of genetic diversity and an increase in the frequency of recessive traits. This is because inbreeding reduces the gene pool, making it more likely that the offspring will inherit the same detrimental traits as their parents.","146":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"I don't know about liquid Al, but I know of no reason why it wouldn't evaporate slowly.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The factually correct statement is: \"When metals are boiled they turn into a vapor or a gas, just like other liquids.\"\n* The statement \"I don't know about liquid Al, but I know of no reason why it wouldn't evaporate slowly\" is incorrect because it implies that aluminum does not evaporate slowly, which contradicts the statement that metals can sublimate (change directly from a solid to a gas).\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"I don't know if any metals sublimate.\"","147":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If you stay asleep, you move a lot more.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the relationship between sleeping and movement is not directly correlated. Sleep is a state of inactivity, and while it's true that some people may experience movement during sleep, it's not a universal characteristic of sleep itself.","148":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"When a baby is born, doctors can see the characteristics that point to dwarfism, like a shorter than average neck, flattened cheekbones, shorter arms\/legs but average size hands\/feet.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"When a baby is born, doctors can see the characteristics that point to dwarfism, like a shorter than average head, flattened cheekbones, shorter arms\/legs.\"\n\nThe factually correct answer is that doctors cannot diagnose dwarfism during pregnancy, not when a baby is born.","149":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If we did not have this filter there would not be too much optical \"noise\" in darkness, so the filter is an unimportant adaption, and a weakness.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"If we did not have this filter there would not be too much optical noise in darkness, so the filter is an important adaptation, and a strength.\"\n\nThe word \"weakness\" is incorrect here as it should be \"strength\" to make the sentence grammatically correct and accurate.","150":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The immune response is going to be big.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"The immune response is going to be mild.\"","151":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It's like comparing peaches and apriocots to green beans, you wouldn't be surprised at all when a person is allergic to the first category and not the other.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- Peaches and apricots are both stone fruits, whereas green beans are a type of legume. This is the key difference that makes them distinct from each other.\n- Legumes, including peanuts, are a group of seeds that belong to the Fabaceae family, whereas peaches and apricots are not.","152":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"On an interesting side note, leptin resistance (reduced response of tissue to the hormone) is thought to result from over production by excess adipose tissue in the obese.\"\n\nThe correct answer is that leptin resistance is actually caused by a decrease in leptin production, not an overproduction.","153":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n* \"look like negative mass.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n* \"look like negative mass.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe term \"look like\" is a comparative adjective, whereas \"negative mass\" is a property of a physical entity. The sentence implies that the particles exhibit negative mass-like behavior, but it doesn't explicitly state that they have negative mass. This is incorrect, as the term \"negative mass\" is a fundamental concept in physics, and the sentence doesn't provide any evidence or explanation for why the particles behave in this way.","154":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"When a rocket is moving quickly, the force applied acts over a large distance.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the Oberth effect actually states that when a rocket is moving quickly, the force applied acts over a small distance, not a large distance.","155":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Detaching electrons from atoms with a laser (photodetachment) only really work with anions (negative ions) and I believe with gas only.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because photodetachment is actually the process that occurs when an electron is removed from an atom or molecule, not an anion. An anion is a negatively charged ion, whereas an electron is a negatively charged particle.","156":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"the Messier catalogue\".","157":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"It is only after ejaculation that swimming activity is triggered presumably due to other components in semen.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \n\"It is only after ejaculation that sperm are released from the testes.\"","158":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Does that mean their camera take a picture of light midway through the room?\"\n\nCorrected sentence:\nDoes that mean they take a picture of the light that is midway through the room?","159":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Some (but not all) of the antibodies and cells are in the donated blood.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that some donated blood contains antibodies and cells, which is not the case. The correct answer is that the donated blood contains antibodies, not both antibodies and cells.","160":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Furthermore part of the body's response to blood loss is to dilate small blood vessels such as arterioles to maintain adequate pressure.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the correct response is that the body maintains adequate pressure through constricting the arterioles, not dilating them.","161":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Having gas in your stomach will only change the tone of your burps.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the statement that the stomach's gas changes the tone of your voice is not supported by scientific evidence. The human voice is primarily produced by the movement of air through the vocal cords, and the sensation of gas in the stomach is not directly related to the tone of the voice.","162":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Maybe this gives you some hand-waving intuation.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because \"hand-waving\" is an informal or colloquial term for \"visualizing\" or \"imaging,\" but it is not a formal or scientifically accurate way to describe the process of Fourier transforming spatial coordinates.\n\nCorrected answer: \n\nI've been through the derivation and my understanding is still very much in the 'because that's what the math tells us' territory.","163":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Is it due to the SRBs being more powerful than the Shuttle's main engines?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"It causes the vehicle to pitch nose-down uncontrollably during flight.\"","164":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Three bones in the ear doesn't count because each bone is different.\"\n\nCorrected sentence: There are three bones in the human ear, which are the ossicles (the malleus, incus, and stapes).","165":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\"Its only a design\/cost effective choice.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the reason for the standard layout of US electrical wall sockets is actually due to the safety and efficiency reasons, not just a design choice.","166":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The motion of particles, for example, is *immensely* complex, so we break it down and name each and every one of the different things going on.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"The motion of particles, for example, is extremely complex, so we break it down and name each and every one of the different things going on.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The word \"immensely\" is incorrect; it should be \"extremely\".\n- The sentence should end with a question mark, not a period.","167":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"This weak friction does not create very high torque, which makes a Tesla turbine useless for any application that requires that high torque.\"\n\nCorrected answer:\nTesla turbines are actually more efficient than conventional turbines because they can operate at a lower speed, resulting in a higher torque.","168":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Potassium Chloride is just used because, like Sodium Chloride, it's easy to make and disolves in water.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because Potassium Chloride (KCl) is actually a highly corrosive and toxic compound that can be hazardous to human health, whereas Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is a common household salt that is safe to use.","169":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Since we are talking about continuous rotations, the angle part is explicitly given by the torque vector.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because torque is not explicitly given by the torque vector in continuous rotations. Instead, the angle of rotation is determined by the torque vector, but it is not explicitly given.","170":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Genetically she is now O+ as her DNA has changed, the eggs in her ovaries now dictate for the production of O+ blood.\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nThe child will be O+ because the father's blood type does not affect the child's blood type, as the child inherits only one set of genes from each parent, and the genes that determine blood type are determined by the mother's genes.","171":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Remember, fish breathe oxygen that is already combined in the H2O molecule\u2014not dissolved oxygen.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Remember, fish breathe oxygen that is dissolved in the water, not combined in the air.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Not dissolved\" is incorrect because fish do not breathe dissolved oxygen; they breathe dissolved oxygen in the water.\n* \"H2O molecule\" is also incorrect because it is a chemical formula for water, not a term used to describe the state of oxygen in the water.","172":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Is there something similar with light? I've sort of been working under the impression that you can't have different amplitudes of light, and that light intensity is based on the density of photons emitted, not the properties of the photons themselves.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Is there something similar with light? I've sort of been working under the impression that you can't have different amplitudes of light, and that light intensity is based on the density of photons emitted, not the properties of the photons themselves, and light waves have amplitude.\"","173":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"The adrenal glands has the greatest blood supply per gram of tissue.\"\n\nThis is incorrect because the adrenal glands actually receive blood supply from 3 arteries, not 3 grams per gram of tissue.","174":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Because of this, it would be entirely possible that we may have to go days, even weeks with little to eat if the food supply was short.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that the absence of food is a problem that occurred in the past and has persisted, which is not the case. The correct answer states that it's been \"only in the last few thousand years\" that we have an abundance of food, implying that food scarcity was a problem in the past, not the present.","175":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Are there some things which impair the absorption of nutrients, vitamins and minerals?\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that there are specific things that can impair the absorption of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, which is not the case. The correct sentence should be:\n\"Are there any things that impair the absorption of nutrients, vitamins and minerals?\"","176":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If the Genus is different it's very likely to graft - So yes, a maple apple tree is extremely likely.\"\n\nThis sentence contains incorrect information. The correct statement would be:\n\"If the Genus is different, it's unlikely to graft - So no, a maple apple tree is unlikely.\"","177":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Without load the center of mass is close to the \"front\" of the crane but still between the supports.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nThe factually correct statement is: \"With maximal load the center of mass is closer to the \"front\" of the crane but still between the supports.\"\n\nThe reason why the counterweight does not tip before lifting any weight is because the counterweight is designed to counteract the weight of the load, and the counterweight's position is carefully calculated to ensure it is at the same height as the load, thus balancing it out. When the crane is lifted with a load, the counterweight's position does not move, and the crane remains balanced.","178":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"You start with some synchrotron radiation (the spectra vary, but something like UV or x-ray), and absorb it into a high-energy electron beam.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because synchrotron radiation is typically generated by accelerating charged particles, not by absorbing radiation.","179":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There's a lot of clever pruning happening with the neural network but this is the main algorithm surrounding the whole thing and it fundamentally uses randomness though the goal is to simulate enough random games that you aren't at the whim of small statistical fluctuations.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence is: \"There's a lot of clever pruning happening with the neural network but this is the main algorithm surrounding the whole thing and it fundamentally uses randomness though the goal is to simulate enough random games that you aren't at the whim of small statistical fluctuations.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence is actually a statement about the main algorithm of AlphaGo, which is Monte Carlo Tree Search, and its goal of simulating random games to find the best strategy.","180":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Hitting an electron isn't really a thing, neither the photon or electron are small hard spheres.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Hitting an electron is a real thing, and the photon is a small, hard sphere.\"","181":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"There is some evidence that excess cortisol can cause the hippocampus to be damaged in various ways.\"\n\nExplanation: The hippocampus is actually a structure in the temporal lobe of the brain, and it is not a specific area that can be damaged by cortisol. The hippocampus is more commonly associated with memory formation and spatial navigation.","182":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Then the heated materials and air inside do not leave the car while continuing to accumulate more heat.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the statement that the heat accumulates more heat inside the car is actually true, not the fact that it doesn't leave. The correct analysis is that the heated materials and air inside the car continue to absorb more heat, causing the temperature to rise, not that they accumulate more heat.","183":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"For example, being tickled is much worse for some people than it is for others.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the question asks about animals, not humans. Tickling is a common behavior that is experienced by many animals, but it's not something that humans can directly experience or measure.","184":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"An example of this are chemical handwarmers which have a little metal piece in them and when you knick the piece a perfect surface for crystllisation results in the formatiom of tiny crystals and little exothermal energy.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"An example of this are chemical handwarmers which have a little metal piece in them and when you kink the piece a perfect surface for crystallization results in the formation of tiny crystals and little exothermal energy.\"\n\nThe word \"kink\" should be \"kink\" (note the difference in spelling).","185":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"So it's *possible*, but to my knowledge there isn't currently anything postulated to exist from partial remains found (as was the case with the squids before we found live ones).\"\n\nThis sentence contains a factual error because the statement \"there isn't currently anything postulated to exist from partial remains found\" is incorrect. The statement that \"the first pictures of a live giant squid in its natural habitat were taken before 2004\" is also incorrect.","186":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"there are many energy states for these electrons to jump into if they are excited.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because electrons in a metal do not have energy states that they can jump into if they are excited. In metals, electrons are free to move freely and are in a \"sea of free electrons\" due to their delocalization, but they do not have discrete energy levels that they can jump into.","187":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"hrm. I'm not even entirely sure if it would be possible simply by heating.\"\n\nThis sentence contains an informal and informal tone, which is not typical of a scientific or professional context.","188":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's highly unlikely there would be any defects, as the two people breeding would definitely carry genes which would lead to defects.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that two people breeding would definitely produce defects, which contradicts the fact that birth defects are not inherent effects of inbreeding.","189":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Finally the increase of the stress hormone cortisol has an effect in \"priming\" the brain to be hyper-aware of the surroundings, thus increasing reaction time when a stimulus does occur.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because cortisol is a hormone involved in the body's \"fight or flight\" response, which is actually the opposite of what the sentence implies. The correct effect of cortisol is to prepare the body for \"fight or flight\" by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy levels, not to increase reaction time.","190":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Maybe Richard Feynman, it sounds clever enough for him to say something to the effect of  \"Don't worry about it, if it does ignite the atmosphere, no one will blame you.\"\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\n\"Maybe Richard Feynman, it sounds clever enough for him to say something to the effect of  \"Don't worry about it, if it does ignite the atmosphere, everyone will blame you.\"","191":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"There is a very real danger of radiologic contamination from radioisotopes that strong.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: \"There is a very real danger of radioisotope contamination from radioactive waste.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- The RTG on Mars Curiosity is not a consumer-level device, it's a scientific instrument used by NASA's Curiosity rover.\n- The RTG is indeed a clean and efficient source of energy, as it converts the heat generated by the decay of radioactive isotopes into electricity.\n- The initial cost of an RTG is relatively low, as it uses common and inexpensive radioisotopes.\n- While it is true that there is a real danger of radioisotope contamination from radioactive waste, it is not necessarily a major concern for the device itself, but rather for the handling and storage of the waste generated by the device.","192":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Tooth yellowing isnt the only reason teeth turn yellow.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that there are other reasons for teeth turning yellow, which is not the case. The main reason for tooth yellowing is indeed enamel, which can be affected by factors such as aging, natural wear, and the presence of stains.","193":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Because of this you are more likely to see whites with crooked and over-crowded teeth.\"\n\nCorrected answer: Every dog I have ever seen has had essentially a \"perfect\" set of teeth, whereas about 25% of people I know have quite crooked teeth\/had braces.","194":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Problem is that your displacement is not necessarily going to be large.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Problem is that your displacement is likely going to be large.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The S-wave is a type of seismic wave that propagates through the Earth's surface, causing the ground to move in a horizontal direction. \n* The speed of the S-wave is typically around 6-8 km\/s at the surface, not 2-3 km\/s.\n* The displacement of the S-wave is usually relatively small, typically less than 1-2 meters, not large.","195":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It's easier to see them.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the actual reason why circuit boards are green is not because of the contrast of copper traces on the plastic fiber board, but because the circuit boards are often made from a special type of plastic that has a green color.","196":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If those reactions produce a detectable odor, then the object is losing mass.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"If those reactions produce a detectable odor, then the object is gaining mass.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed or broken down. In the context of the question, the catalyst is the substance that facilitates the reaction that produces the odor. The odor is a byproduct of the reaction, not a result of the catalyst itself being consumed or broken down. The catalyst does not \"lose\" mass, but rather, it helps to speed up the reaction, which would increase the amount of reactants (in this case, odor molecules) being converted into products.","197":"Factually wrong sentence: \"In times of cold, the blood flow (and the other fingers, ie mittens > gloves)\"\n\nCorrected answer: \n Factually correct sentence: \"In times of cold, the blood flow (and the other fingers, ie mittens > gloves)\"\n\nExplanation: The correct sentence should be \"In times of cold, the blood flow to the fingers is reduced, not increased.\"","198":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"This effect is not tied to a light sensitive receptor protein called Rhodopsin.\"\n\nThe correct answer is actually about the lack of the protein rhodopsin, which is the light-sensitive receptor responsible for converting light into visual signals, not the color \"visual purple\".","199":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It will require more effort to lift your own arms above the water and press them below the water.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, in a high-gravity environment, the weight of the water above your head would increase, making it more difficult to lift your arms above the water.","200":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n> It's not that they *can't*, it's just that they're highly unlikely to.\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n> It's not that they *can't*, it's just that they're extremely unlikely to.\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct sentence is factually accurate because:\n- Fingerprints are unique for each individual due to the unique patterns of ridges and grooves on the surface of the fingers.\n- The uniqueness of fingerprints is a well-established scientific fact, and it's not possible for two people to have the same fingerprint.\n- The uniqueness of fingerprints can be verified through databases and other methods, such as DNA analysis, which can identify individuals based on their unique genetic makeup.\n\nThe wrong sentence is incorrect because it implies that it's possible for two people to have the same fingerprints, which is not the case.","201":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Seeing stars\"","202":"boiling away the oxygen from the water","203":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The loss of the ability to swallow (this is what dysphagia is, in case you didn't recognize that word).\"\n\nThe word \"swallow\" is a verb, not a noun. It is the correct term for the act of ingesting food, whereas \"dysphagia\" is the condition that leads to difficulty swallowing.","204":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\n\"Do interactions between the electric and magnetic fields of the photon and atom contribute?\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the interaction between the electric and magnetic fields of the photon and atom is not relevant to the stimulated emission process. Stimulated emission occurs due to the absorption of a photon and the release of an electron from the excited state to the ground state, which is a process driven by the interaction with an electric field, not a magnetic field.","205":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"In order to excite a nucleus, a photon usually needs to be a low-energy radio wave.\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n\"In order to excite a nucleus, a photon usually needs to be a high-energy gamma ray.\"\n\nExplanation:\nRadiation, in this context, refers to high-energy electromagnetic waves, not low-energy radio waves. The nucleus of an atom is a region where protons and neutrons are concentrated, and it is subject to the electromagnetic force, not the electromagnetic radiation. Protons in the nucleus are not affected by photons, as they are positively charged particles and do not interact with electromagnetic radiation.","206":"Factually correct sentence: \"There are GMO trees, but they are much more highly regulated than GMO crops, mainly due to fear of escape into wild populations.\"\n\nCorrected answer: There are GMO trees, but they are much more highly regulated than GMO crops, mainly due to fear of escape into wild populations.","207":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"You need 22 total amino acids in human nutrition.\"\n\nThe correct number of essential amino acids in human nutrition is actually 9, not 22.","208":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"The live skin cells at the basal layer of your epidermis divide and the new cells get pushed upwards towards the surface of your skin.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, not the basal layer. The basal layer is the innermost layer of the epidermis, and it is where the cells are still dividing and producing keratin.","209":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Even though they are close different weather patterns cause a division of plant life in them and separate them.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\n\"Even though they are close different climate zones cause a division of plant life in them and separate them.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe Great Basin and Mojave Deserts are actually adjacent to each other, with the Great Basin being a cold desert and the Mojave being a warm desert. The Mojave is a dry and hot desert, while the Great Basin is a cold desert. The two deserts have different climate zones, which are caused by their distinct geographical features and climate patterns.","210":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Your skin doesn\u2019t hold much of the precursor to vitamin D.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because vitamin D is actually produced in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, not stored in the skin. The precursor to vitamin D is actually cholecalciferol, which is a form of vitamin D3, a derivative of cholesterol.","211":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\n\"By contrast, the orange color in flames is from the glow of small soot particles. That's incandescence, or black-body radiation, the same as in the tungsten filament of a light bulb.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The sentence is incorrect because the color of a flame is not determined by the amount of soot particles, but rather by the presence of hydrocarbon fuel and oxygen.\n* The correct sentence should be: \"The orange color in flames is from the glow of small soot particles. That's incandescence, or black-body radiation, the same as in the tungsten filament of a light bulb.\"\n\nThe correct answer is that the color of a flame is determined by the amount of hydrocarbon fuel and oxygen, not by the amount of soot particles.","212":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"A stack of 16,172,452 pennies will be about 14.3 miles tall.\"","213":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"By having a large amount of time to go through you will have more time to extract nutrients.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the length of the intestines directly affects nutrient extraction, which is not the case. In fact, the length of the intestines is more related to the surface area available for nutrient uptake and the presence of villi and microvilli, as mentioned in the correct answer.","214":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Is it possible to get an average expansion ratio for Jupiter and therefore a measurement of how large Jupiter would be (in physical dimensions e.g. diameter) if we cooled it enough to condense?\"\n\nThis sentence contains the incorrect calculation: \n1. The correct calculation should be: \nJupiter's density = 1.898E27 kg \/ (5.972E24 kg) \nJupiter's density = 316.51","215":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"That would be those in front of the joint.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"That would be those in front of the nerve.\"\n\nThe reason is that the nerves are not pinched in the joint itself, but rather in the space around it, which is referred to as the intervertebral for the spine or the intercostal for the ribcage.","216":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"However, since it can take an exceedingly long time to reach equilibrium, this approach is limited in it's practical utility.\"\n\nThis sentence contains an error in the word \"exceedingly\" which is a superlative adjective used to describe a degree of something. In this context, it should be \"exceedingly\" or simply \"exceeding\".","217":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"it remains iron regardless of it being in a solid or liquid (or gaseous) state.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"it remains iron regardless of it being in a solid, liquid, or gaseous state.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- \"it remains iron regardless of it being in a solid or liquid (or gaseous) state\" is incorrect because iron can change from solid to liquid (melting) and from liquid to gas (vaporizing).","218":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Is this true?\"\n\nThe correct answer is: \"I can't imagine a mechanism by which the body could absorb elemental iron\"","219":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Some things to consider, though, it wouldn't be quality, as much as quantity.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Some things to consider, though, it wouldn't be quality, as much as the number of plants.\"","220":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The general platypus morphology has existed since at least late Oligocene as evident in the fossil record exemplified by the extinct genus *Obdurodon*.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- The platypus has existed since at least late Oligocene, which is a fact.\n- The genus *Obdurodon* is a fossil genus, but it is not the only one. There are other extinct genera that are also mentioned in the answer.","221":"Factually correct sentence: \"If by energy you mean light and heat.\"\n\nCorrected answer: Does Earth get energy from stars other than the sun? \nAnswer: Yes, Earth gets energy from stars other than the sun.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The sentence \"We can see them so we're at least some light is getting here\" is factually correct, as we can see stars through telescopes.\n- The sentence \"being able to see the stars at night is there light (which is a form of energy) reaching us\" is factually correct, as light is a form of energy that we receive from the stars.\n- The sentence \"But in the main way earth 'uses' the Suns energy, photosynthesis other stars do contribute\" is factually incorrect, as photosynthesis is actually a process that occurs in plants on Earth, not on other stars.\n- The sentence \"Could go far more in depth but not really sure if this is what you mean\" is factually correct, as it acknowledges that the question is open to interpretation, but does not provide a clear answer.","222":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Is that enough to form new and exotic metals or elements?\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The sentence is incorrect because it implies that new elements can be formed from the center of a nuclear explosion, which is not accurate.\n* The center of a nuclear explosion is actually extremely hot, but it is not hot enough to form new elements or exotic metals.\n* The factually correct sentence should be: \"Is that enough to form new and exotic elements?\"","223":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"in a sort of positive feedback that goes both ways(losing O2 or CO molecules predisposes the RBC to lose more)\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"in a sort of positive feedback that goes both ways (prevents O2 or CO molecules from being released)\"\n\nExplanation:\n- \"positive feedback\" is not a correct term in this context.\n- \"prevents\" is not a correct term for what the sentence is describing.\n- \"O2 or CO molecules\" should be \"O2 or CO molecules\" (since the sentence is referring to both oxygen and carbon monoxide).\n- \"losses\" should be \"prevents\" (to agree with the correct term \"prevents\").\n- \"both ways\" should be \"prevents\" (since the sentence is describing a one-way process that prevents release of oxygen or carbon monoxide).","224":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Many factors, really.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Many factors, really, including differences in atomic structure, electron configuration, and the overall charge of the ion itself.\"","225":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If the machinery that degrades alcohol is also involved in metabolism of medications (which could mean that it degrades them or that it activates them), then \u2014 broadly speaking \u2014 drinking alcohol can have one of three effects:\"\n\nThe correct sentence should read:\n\n\"If the machinery that degrades alcohol is occupied with medications and ignores alcohol, then \u2014 broadly speaking \u2014 drinking alcohol can have one of three effects:\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the machinery (liver) can degrade both alcohol and medications simultaneously, which is not the case. The liver can only degrade alcohol, not medications.","226":"Here is the original answer with the factually wrong sentence:\n\nSuppose a patient is given the treatment for rabies after getting bitten and then gets cured after a while. Are there any chances the infection might still stay active somewhere in the body for years? Are there any scenarios where the cured person still has a possibility to get infected after many years from the past supposedly cured infection if booster shot isn't taken?\n\nFactually correct sentence: There are no scenarios where the cured person still has a possibility to get infected after many years from the past supposedly cured infection if booster shot isn't taken.\n\nCorrected answer without the factually wrong sentence:\n\nSuppose a patient is given the treatment for rabies after getting bitten and then gets cured after a while. Are there any chances the infection might still stay active somewhere in the body for years?","227":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"are you saying that the probability is 60 events every 30 days or are those just some numbers you're making a bet about or something?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"are you saying that the probability is 60 events every 30 days or are those just some numbers you're making a bet about?\"","228":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Fish will tend to swim closer to the surface to avoid any turbulence.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because hurricanes can create strong winds and storm surges that can cause turbulence in the ocean, which can be detrimental to marine life.","229":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Phase changes are not (directly) a function of temperature, but are a function of pressure.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because phase changes, such as evaporation and condensation, are indeed directly related to temperature, not pressure. In a vacuum, there is no air resistance to cause evaporation, so phase changes occur regardless of temperature, but the rate of evaporation depends on the temperature.","230":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"2. organ rejection is caused by \"foreign DNA,\" and it is not caused by the immune system seeing unrecognized cell exterior markers and saying \"attack!\"\"\n\nCorrected answer without changes:\n\nQuestion: Why doesn't the immune system reject donated blood if they have different DNA but same blood type?\nI do know that there's a term of transplant rejection but why doesn't it apply to blood as well when they have the same blood type?\n\nAnswer: \n1. Blood does not have a lot of DNA. Red blood cells have no nuclei, only white blood cells do. The rest of blood consists of water, proteins, sugars, and dissolved gases. Also, I believe donation blood is treated to kill all white blood cells, meaning no foreign DNA is introduced.\n\n2. organ rejection is caused by \"foreign DNA,\" and it is not caused by the immune system seeing unrecognized cell exterior markers and saying \"attack!\" Both blood and organ donation work by matching these external cell markers. But blood is much simpler than organs, do there are fewer factors to account for and thus blood transfusion is much easier.","231":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If the loss and gain of heat is the reason we feel cold and hot, then why do we feel hot even when the air temperature is lower than our skin and body temp?\"\n\nThe correct answer is that the body detects the loss and gain of heat through the process of convection and conduction, not through the transfer of heat itself. The body detects the loss of heat by measuring the change in temperature of the air around it, which is caused by the movement of warm air away from the body. This is known as convection.","232":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Manufactured Glass is less transparent than any natural glass and cannot be molded into essentially any shape we want.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement is incorrect because glass is not necessarily less transparent than natural glass.\n- The statement is also incorrect because glass can be molded into a wide range of shapes, not just a few.\n- Furthermore, the claim about the transparency of glass is not entirely accurate, as it can vary depending on the type of glass and its purity.","233":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"No salt\"","234":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"this creates a low pressure area inside the pipe which sucks air back in, creating another wave that propogates back in the opposite direction.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"this creates a low pressure area inside the pipe that pushes air back in, creating another wave that propagates back in the same direction.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe original sentence implies that the air particles in the pipe are moving in the opposite direction, which is not the case. In an open pipe, the air molecules are pushed back in by the pressure wave, not in the opposite direction.","235":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"As I understand, the sound a ball makes when rolling on a surface is caused by tiny impacts between irregularities on the surface and the ball.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the sound is caused by the ball itself making impacts with the surface, which is not accurate. The sound is actually caused by the irregularities on the surface, not the ball.","236":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If the laws of physics do not depend on what direction your system is facing, then angular momentum is conserved.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"If the laws of physics depend on what direction your system is facing, then angular momentum is conserved.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct explanation of Noether's theorem is as follows:\nNoether's theorem states that every continuous symmetry in a physical system is associated with a conserved quantity, such as energy or momentum. The symmetry can be rotational, translational, or other types of symmetries. The theorem is named after the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach, who first proposed it in the late 19th century.","237":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It depends on the type of reactor, and the enrichment of the fuel.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"It depends on the type of fuel, and the enrichment of the fuel.\"\n\nThe reason for this error is that nuclear reactors can be classified into different types, such as Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR), Boiling Water Reactors (BWR), and Gas-cooled Reactors, among others. Each type has its own specific design and operating characteristics, which affect the amount of fuel needed for refueling. Additionally, the enrichment level of the fuel used in each type of reactor also varies.","238":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"They disperse and the cycle stops.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that the misfolded proteins are somehow \"stopping\" the cycle, which is not accurate. The correct sentence should read:\n\n\"They disperse, and the cycle continues.\"","239":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Above all though, spiders are vibration-sensing machines, and not just from their webs, but from any substrate they're on, and the air around them.\"\n\nThe correct sentence would be: \"Above all though, spiders are vibration-sensing machines, and not just from their webs, but from any surface they're on.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be a rewording of the original sentence, removing the word \"any\", which changes the meaning and makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.","240":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It's covered in depth in, I think, the first chapter of Feynman's *QED.*\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\"It's covered in depth in, I think, the first chapter of Feynman's *QED.*\"","241":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Saline (just salt water that matches your blood's salt levels.\"\n\nThis sentence contains incorrect information. While it is true that saline solution can be used in medical settings to mimic blood, it is not typically used to match the exact salt levels in a patient's blood. The correct statement should be:\n\n\"Saline solution is used to mimic the electrolyte balance in the body, but it does not match the exact salt levels in a patient's blood.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\nFor injections, usually not Saline (just water that matches your blood's electrolyte balance, also known as isotonic solution, which is specifically designed to have the same electrolyte balance as human blood, or 0.9% sodium chloride solution, to match the patient's blood.","242":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It's not a garden, nor will it be one soon.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the answer claims that there are no bacteria or fungi to cycle carbon or nitrogen, which is incorrect. In fact, microorganisms like bacteria and fungi play a crucial role in the Martian soil ecosystem, helping to cycle nutrients and support life.","243":"Factually correct sentence: The pleasure and craving mechanisms are thus hardwired to those resources, which in our modern world we have made superabundant.\n\nThe incorrect sentence is: \n\"where rich energy sources such as concentrated sugars and fats were rare and precious things.\"","244":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There aren't reliable, large-scale epidemiology studies before that era--at the very earliest, the data goes back to the mid-century.\"\n\nCorrected sentence:\n\n\"There aren't reliable, large-scale epidemiology studies before that era--at the earliest, the data goes back to the 19th century.\"","245":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"90+% of the times I remember a light burning out, it was when I flipped on the switch.\"\n\nThis sentence contains the incorrect statement that 90% of the times, the light burns out when it is flipped on.","246":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There was carbon dioxide in the accretion disc that formed Earth\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the accretion disc is not a known geological process that forms Earth. The accretion disc is a hypothetical region around a newly formed star where gas and dust are trapped and accrete, but it is not a process that formed Earth.","247":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It's less efficient the smaller the ship gets, so you usually only see it on large tankers and heavy-duty ships.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the shape of the bow (the front of the ship) does not directly affect the drag of the ship. The drag is primarily influenced by the hull shape and the speed of the ship, not its size.","248":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"And her young sister Emelye.\"","249":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"A detailed response is very much appreciated.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"A detailed response is very helpful.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Beneficial\" is an adjective that means having a positive effect, but it does not necessarily mean helpful.\n* \"Appreciated\" is a verb that means to be admired or enjoyed, but it does not necessarily imply a positive effect.\n* \"Detailed\" is an adjective that means thorough and well-explained, but it does not necessarily mean helpful.\n* \"Helpful\" is an adjective that means assisting or benefiting, but it does not necessarily imply that the response will be appreciated.\n* \"Detailed response\" is a phrase that means a response that provides a thorough explanation, but it does not necessarily imply that the response will be helpful.\n\nCorrected answer:\n\nIt is beneficial because if they are cut at an angle, the crushing of the xylem (vessels) will not cut off the flow of H2O and minerals to the rest of the plant.","250":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Coral is not fussy about temperature, salt levels and small silt particles in the water and can survive a wide range of conditions.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because coral is actually sensitive to changes in temperature, salt levels, and water chemistry, including the presence of excess nutrients and high levels of certain minerals, which can stress the coral and cause it to expel the zoozanthallae, leading to coral bleaching.","251":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The babies are heavy and sturdy and resist the flow of the water.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because seahorses are actually born live, not dead. They are tiny, juvenile versions of adult seahorses, and they are born with their eyes open and their fins developed.","252":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"As to the thrust of your question, why are terrestrial animals smaller today (I assume).\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"As to the thrust of your question, why are terrestrial animals smaller today?\"\n\nThe reason for this is that dinosaurs were terrestrial animals, meaning they lived on land, whereas terrestrial animals, such as humans and many other mammals, have evolved to live on land.","253":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If you go exactly East, or exactly West, you'll encounter places where it shines the same amount of hours.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the amount of sunlight received on Earth varies due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, which causes the sun to appear to move slightly north and south throughout the year.","254":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"So basically, when you touch something hot with your finger, it takes your finger more time to get hot than it would take your mouth.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"So basically, when you touch something hot with your finger, it takes your mouth more time to get hot than it would take your finger.\"","255":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Often they are correct, but have been wrong.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"Often the flu shot is correct, but sometimes it is wrong.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence is:\n\"if that particular strain, with the same antibody flag, comes back in a later year, you're covered.\"","256":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If the points are not collinear, yes. You can choose any two of the points and draw their perpendicular bisector, and do the same with another combination of two points.\"\n\nThis sentence is wrong because it implies that you can always find two points and draw their perpendicular bisector, which is not true. In general, it is not possible to draw a circle that intersects all three points if they are not collinear.","257":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"The water wouldn't go anywhere but downwards.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, according to the laws of physics, water flowing out of a nozzle would indeed move in the opposite direction, not downwards.","258":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It's simply that the ISS and its associated people and objects are falling together.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the International Space Station (ISS) is actually in orbit around the Earth, not falling towards it. The ISS is in a state of continuous free fall around the Earth, but it does not actually \"fall\" towards the planet.","259":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The information held in a brain doesn't exactly work like a computer.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"The information held in a brain doesn't exactly work like a computer.\"\n\nThe correct analysis:\n\n* The brain does not store information in a centralized location like a computer.\n* The brain is a complex, decentralized system with billions of interconnected neurons and trillions of synapses, making it difficult to replicate exactly.\n* The idea of replicating every neuron and connection is a highly complex task, and the brain's information storage and processing is not a straightforward process like a computer's.","260":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If you're mentally depressed because of your illness (Covid, Cancer, Flu etc.) that you're actually slowing down your bodies recovery and its ability to defend itself.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\n\"If you're mentally depressed because of your illness (Covid, Cancer, Flu etc.) that you're actually weakening your body's ability to recover and defend itself.\"","261":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"Each facet receives an unfocused image, but thousands of them together give a decent-enough view.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because insects have compound eyes, which consist of many small lenses (or facets) that work together to form a single image, whereas human eyes have a single lens (the retina) that focuses light onto a single point of the retina.","262":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Moving the arms helps counteract this.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, in reality, swinging arms does not help counteract the rotation of the body.","263":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"One of the big mistakes people make is that they forget to open the suction and discharge valves so the pump continuously spins the water that is trapped in the casing until it turns to steam and can blow up our cast steel pump casings no problem.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the water can be made to boil by continuously spinning the water trapped in the pump casing, which is not a realistic or safe scenario.","264":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"I would easily float in lava.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the force of gravity is stronger than the net force pushing the person to the surface of lava, which is not true. The force of gravity is still acting on the person, but it is balanced by the buoyant force of the lava.","265":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The magnet will try to align with the direction of the field but if the frequency is high enough it will be switching faster than the material can align so when the current is turned off everything will end up aligned randomly, making it non magnetic.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"The magnet will try to align with the direction of the field.\"","266":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There are a bunch of object completely covered in ice, and some even made almost exclusively of ice (like most comets and the rings of Saturn).\"","267":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It is impossible to estimate the size of the entire universe.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"It is impossible to estimate the size of the observable universe.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the observable universe is finite, and its size is determined by the universe's expansion history, which we can estimate with some accuracy. The factually correct sentence should be:\n\"It is impossible to estimate the size of the entire universe, as its size is determined by the universe's expansion history.\"","268":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Changing the amount of grow and dormant times gives you the difference between scalp hair and arm hair.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because hair growth and dormancy cycles are not the same thing. Hair growth is a continuous process, while the dormancy phase is a temporary period where the hair follicle stops producing hair.","269":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"one we do be dehydrated for years, what would be the long term consequences?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"One specific consequence that comes to mind is kidney stones.\"","270":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Pigmented skin absorbs UV light and prevents more of the light from entering the tissue.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, as the answer explains, unpigmented skin (lighter skin) reflects more light, not absorbs it.","271":"Factually incorrect sentence: \"Photosynthesis speeds up with a minor increase in heat.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- Photosynthesis is a complex process that involves various factors like CO2, light, water, and temperature, but it is not directly dependent on heat.\n- While it's true that temperature can affect photosynthesis, it's not a minor increase in heat that would make a significant difference.\n- The statement \"Photosynthesis speeds up with a minor increase in heat\" is incorrect because the relationship between heat and photosynthesis is more complex, and it's not a simple linear increase.","272":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Otherwise all that triplet-ground-state oxygen in the atmosphere would become much more reactive, and the whole planet would instantly become engulfed in flames.\"\n\nCorrected answer: \nDoes electron spin affect the formation of a bond? \nThe factually correct answer is: \nDoes electron spin affect the formation of a bond?\n\nAnalysis:\n- The correct statement is that electron spin affects the formation of a bond, as it is the spin of electrons that determines their orientation in a molecule, which in turn influences the bonding between atoms. \n- The factually correct statement \"L and S are conserved independently\" is incorrect because the spin of the electrons is not conserved; it is the orbital angular momentum that is conserved.\n- The factually correct statement \"SO-coupling is significant in light elements\" is correct.\n- The factually correct statement \"L and S are conserved independently\" is correct.\n- The factually correct statement \"the reaction is considered 'spin forbidden'\" is correct.\n- The factually correct statement \"spin orbit coupling is fast\/effective enough that bond formation always occurs\" is correct.\n- The factually correct statement \"the whole planet would instantly become engulfed in flames\" is incorrect because the statement is an exaggeration and does not reflect the actual effect of electron spin on the formation of a bond.","273":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"in general\"","274":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Today this matter is at much larger distances and so far away that we will never see how this matter looks today.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the matter is expanding and will eventually be visible to us, which contradicts the established understanding of the universe's expansion. The correct understanding is that the universe is still expanding, and light from distant matter is being stretched and shifted towards the observer, but we will never see the matter itself because it is moving away from us.","275":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"This is not how glass cutters work.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The sentence is incorrect because glass cutters are actually used to cut through glass by applying high pressure to the edge of the glass, which breaks the glass, not by causing micro-fractures.\n* The sentence is also incorrect because it implies that glass cutters are designed to work by applying force to cause micro-fractures, which is not how they function.","276":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"In some regions some fish survive by burring themselves deep in the mud and going into a kind of hibernation until the water returns.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because fish do not burrow themselves deep in the mud and go into a kind of hibernation. They typically live in aquatic environments and do not experience hibernation in the same way that some terrestrial animals do.","277":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It's somewhat of a toroidal (donut) shaped distribution, with higher density at low inclinations.\"\n\nThis sentence contains an incorrect term \"toroidal\", which is a term used to describe a doughnut-shaped object, not a distribution of asteroids.","278":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It gives the impression, even if totally unjustified given current technology, that the text was better considered and meant to be taken seriously.\"\n\nThis sentence contains a factual error: \"even if totally unjustified given current technology\" is a grammatical error, and \"taken seriously\" is a subjective judgment that is not supported by evidence.","279":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"A hemolytic anemia cannot occur with a type O mother who has a type A or B child since they do not have anti A and B igG.\"\n\nCorrected Answer: \nIf a blood type +A mother had an +AB baby, why doesn't the mother's developed anti-B antibodies attack the baby's blood as it contains a B antigen?","280":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"cells acquire fewer mutations when they divide.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"cells acquire mutations when they divide.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe statement \"cells acquire fewer mutations when they divide\" is incorrect because it implies that cells acquire fewer mutations when they divide, which is not true. In reality, cells can acquire mutations at any point in their life cycle, including during cell division.","281":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"There are gases (just air, for the most part) dissolved in the water, and over time the gases will escape.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"There are gases dissolved in the water, and over time, the dissolved gases will escape.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct explanation is that the dissolved gases (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide) in water are not just air, but also other gases dissolved in the water. Over time, these dissolved gases will escape from the water through a process called diffusion, where the dissolved gases move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. This process is driven by the concentration gradient, where the dissolved gases move from the areas of high concentration to the areas of low concentration.","282":"Factually correct sentence: \"That's not nearly enough energy to melt a cube of ice 400 meters on each side.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The correct answer would be catastrophic as it is highly unlikely that the amount of energy required to melt a cube of ice 400 meters on each side is negligible, let alone \"not nearly enough.\"\n- The energy required to melt ice is actually a significant amount, and the amount of energy required to melt a cube of ice 400 meters on each side would be substantial, potentially releasing massive amounts of energy and causing widespread destruction.\n- The melting of the ice sheet would indeed put a big hole in it, as the ice would break apart and form a large crevasse.\n- The fallout would not greatly increase the melting speed of the ice sheet, but rather, it would create a massive crater that would release large amounts of ash and debris into the atmosphere.\n- The amount of ash covering the ice sheet would depend on various factors such as wind patterns, temperature, and the amount of ash released.","283":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The CPU in your phone understands the same set of instructions as the CPU in your laptop.\"\n\nThe correct answer is: \"The CPU in your phone understands the same set of instructions as the CPU in your laptop.\"\n\nExplanation: The CPU in a computer is not a chip that defines what the instructions are, but rather the Central Processing Unit (CPU) is a type of chip that executes instructions. The instructions are defined by the Central Processing Unit (CPU), but the CPU itself is not the one that executes them.","284":"Factually correct sentence: The moon weighs a bit under 70 billion billion tonnes.\n\nAnalysis: \n- The factually correct sentence states that the moon weighs a bit under 70 billion billion tonnes.\n- The question claims that the Earth weighs six thousand billion billion tonnes, which is a factually incorrect statement as the Earth's mass is approximately 5.97 x 10^24 kilograms, not 6,000 billion billion tonnes.\n- The second sentence claims that the moon weighs a bit under 70 billion billion tonnes, which is a factual statement about the moon's mass.","285":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"I am going to go ahead and assume that your breathing patterns do not change (i.e. breathe more through your nose when hungry and mouth when not hungry).\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"I am going to go ahead and assume that your breathing patterns do not change (i.e. breathe more through your mouth when hungry and more through your nose when not hungry).\"\n\nThe reason for this incorrect statement is that the statement that breathing patterns do not change between hungry and full is incorrect. The brain's breathing patterns do change, but it's not directly related to hunger or fullness.","286":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Dogs are absolutely freaked out by certain smells.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Dogs are probably freaked out by certain smells.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe sentence \"freaked out\" is an idiomatic expression that means to be frightened or startled, whereas the correct word is \"freaked\" which is a less common verb that means to be shocked or surprised. The word \"absolutely\" is also incorrect as it implies certainty, whereas \"probably\" is a more suitable word to express a degree of likelihood.","287":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Two side effects happen, blood volume decreases and some vessels dilate (others constrict).\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Two side effects happen, blood volume increases and some vessels constrict.\"","288":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Some of these will be newly made particles of types we already know.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that the newly produced particles are new types of particles that we don't know about, which contradicts the fact that the Large Hadron Collider is designed to study the properties of known particles.","289":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"It works by slightly decreasing the pressure on the surface of the blade.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because fans do not work by decreasing the pressure on the surface of the blade. The actual mechanism of a fan is to increase the velocity (or kinetic energy) of the air, which is achieved by increasing the pressure on the surface of the blade.","290":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"On the topic of He vs non He detergents, I believe that the He detergents do not foam (or foam less), and rinse away more readily than traditional detergents.\"\n\nThe correct sentence would be:\n\n\"On the topic of He vs non He detergents, I believe that the He detergents do not foam as much, and rinse away more readily than traditional detergents.\"\n\nThe correct sentence contains the factually incorrect statement that He detergents do not foam, which is incorrect.","291":"Short term memories are formed by transient synaptic plasticities and Long term memories are formed from these short term ones by Long Term Potentiation (its the most well accepted neural correlate for memory formation as of now). The short term memories are formed in the frontal cortex which is very robust starting early age but the hippocampus (also called as the neocortex where most of the long term memories are thought to be stored) develops even until the mid-20s in humans. From this perspective, infants may not consciously remember anything as the short term memories cannot easily get translated to the long term memories and get stored in the brain (we don\u2019t truly know the chemical\/physical nature of memory yet).","292":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"For all those arguing with momentums that can further accelerate the ball after it has been thrown (no flick involved)\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the ball can accelerate after it has been thrown, which is not true according to the laws of physics. The momentum of an object remains constant in the absence of external forces, so the ball's momentum is conserved, not its velocity.","293":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Without blood flow delivering oxygen to the brain neural activity continues for hours.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the duration of brain death is typically defined as 30 minutes, not hours.","294":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If you fell to either side, you would be falling down a hill.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, according to the physics of a cube, the force of gravity would still be pulling you towards the center of the cube, even if you were falling from an edge. The edges and corners of a cube are indeed further from the center than other points on the surface, which means you would still be falling towards the center, not down a hill.","295":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It prevented us from taking in more nutrients, especially animal fats and protein, while our digestive systems grew over time.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that cooking made it easier for humans to digest food, which is not the case. In fact, cooking made it more difficult for humans to digest food, as it broke down nutrients and made it easier for the digestive system to absorb them.","296":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"The flu does not infect cells and does not trigger an immune response to kill infected cells.\"\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the flu virus (influenza) does indeed infect cells and trigger an immune response to kill infected cells, which is part of the body's defense mechanism to fight off the infection.\n\nThe correct statement should be: The flu virus does infect cells and trigger an immune response to kill infected cells.","297":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"How fun. \"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it is a casual expression of excitement and not a factual statement.","298":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"In the US, commercial FM radio channels are 200 kHz wide, meaning they modulate the frequency by that much and each channel is that far apart.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: \"In the US, commercial FM radio channels are 200 kHz wide, meaning they modulate the frequency by that much and each channel is 200 kHz apart.\"\n\nThe correct information is that FM radio channels are indeed 200 kHz wide, and the difference between two adjacent channels is 200 kHz, not 1 kHz.","299":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\n\"So in addition to increased efficiency from being a ducted fan, you also have slightly faster air.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"So in addition to increased efficiency from being a ducted fan, you also have increased airflow.\"","300":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"On a longer timeframe, it would be more psychological.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"On a longer timeframe, it would be physiological.\"\n\nExplanation: The correct analysis of the given answer is that the factually wrong sentence is \"On a longer timeframe, it would be more psychological.\" The brain's response to a second stimulus is not psychological but physiological, as it involves changes in the receptor cells' sensitivity to the stimulus.","301":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If you interpret it as cardiac arrest, you have lucari01's point about cardioplegia.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because cardioplegia is actually a technique used to preserve the heart during surgery, not to induce a cardiac arrest. It involves cooling the heart to stop its function, but not necessarily to induce a cardiac arrest.","302":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Not to mention many other practical considerations such as: If a rocket explodes after takeoff, would you rather it happen over a somewhat populated mountainous region or over the ocean?\"\n\nThe reason for this sentence is incorrect because it implies that the location of the explosion is a concern, which is not a practical consideration in rocket launch. In reality, the primary concern is the safety of the people on the ground, not the rocket itself.","303":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If it's hydrofluoric or perchloric acid, you run.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because hydrofluoric and perchloric acid are strong acids, not weak acids.","304":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Since the pressure is lower at the mountaintops, the air from the sea level will expand as you lift it higher.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct answer states that the air at high elevations (mountains) is in thermal equilibrium with the air at sea level due to the pressure difference. This is true, as the decrease in atmospheric pressure at higher elevations leads to an increase in temperature due to the expansion of the air.\n\nHowever, the factually incorrect sentence suggests that the expansion of air at high elevations causes it to become warmer, which is incorrect. The expansion actually causes the air to cool, not warm.","305":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"You don't square the wave equation, you square the modulus of the wavefunction \u03a8(x); and that gives you the probability density, which is the probability per unit volume.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"You square the wave function, not the modulus of the wavefunction \u03a8(x); and that gives you the probability density, which is the probability per unit volume.\"\n\nThe correct analysis:\n\n* The Wave Equation is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the behavior of waves, not particles.\n* The square of the wavefunction (\u03a8(x)) gives the probability density, not the probability per unit volume.\n* The wavefunction is a mathematical function that describes the quantum state of a particle, and it is not a physical quantity that can be squared.\n* The probability density is a measure of the probability of finding a particle within a given region of space, not the probability of finding it in a volume.","306":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"For rotating black holes the shape is more complicated.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \n\"For non-rotating black holes the shape is more complicated.\"\n\nExplanation: The statement is incorrect because the shape of a black hole's orbit around a non-rotating black hole is actually spherical, not more complicated.","307":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Sorry if I'm saying bull crap :)\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it's a sarcastic remark, not a factual statement. The phrase \"bull crap\" is an expression used to express strong disapproval or disappointment, and it's not a neutral or accurate way to describe something.","308":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Currently, there are known health detriments to polyphasic sleep, but long term effects are not known.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Currently, there are known health benefits to polyphasic sleep, but long term effects are not known.\"","309":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Your \"blurred surface\" still scatters the same two frequencies (although perhaps not in the same ratio).\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the statement that the light is scattered in the same ratio is not necessarily true. The scattering of light by a surface is determined by the properties of the surface itself, not the frequency of the light.","310":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"With biodegradable items (I assume thats what you mean by compostable) they're usually meant to fully break down once exposed to the environment. If you wanted, the disposal of a used biodegradable cup could be as easy as adding soil to the cup and burying it.\"\n\nThe correct sentence would be:\n\n\"With biodegradable items, they're usually meant to break down in the environment, not soil.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe original sentence suggests that biodegradable items are meant to break down in the environment, which is incorrect. Biodegradable materials are designed to decompose naturally in a short period of time, not in the environment.","311":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"That is enough to build a comprehensive map (or in this case 3D model) which gives you a top down view (or in the case of a full 3D model, any view you want to make)\"","312":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"That's many orders of magnitude more energy than someone jumping though.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the energy of a person jumping is comparable to the energy of an aircraft taking off, which is not true.","313":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"showing that that one cannot be a Sierpinski number.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the correct sentence should be \"showing that it is the smallest\".","314":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"that DON'T do that.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that spiders that don't build webs near artificial light sources are not capable of building webs, which is not true.","315":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Transplanted organs on the other hand, do express these cell-surface proteins and therefore are under surveillance by the immune system.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Transplanted organs on the other hand, do not express these cell-surface proteins and therefore are not under surveillance by the immune system.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- The statement that \"these cell-surface proteins\" is incorrect, as organs do not express cell surface proteins.\n- The statement that \"therefore are under surveillance by the immune system\" is also incorrect, as organs do not express these proteins and are not under surveillance by the immune system.","316":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Earthquakes are unrelated to climate.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"Earthquakes are related to climate.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- Natural Disasters and Global Warming are related as they are both driven by climate change.\n- Natural Disasters (such as hurricanes, droughts, etc.) are related to weather and climate cycles.\n- Ozone depletion is related to climate change.\n- Earthquakes are related to the movement of tectonic plates.\n- Fracking can increase the incidence of earthquakes in an area due to the injection of fluids into the ground, which can cause stress on the rock formations and lead to earthquakes.","317":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It occurs to me though that if all the bandwidth was shared amongst the people, that overall performance would be improved and be less affected by a leecher or two trying to get by.\"\n\nThe sentence contains incorrect information. Bandwidth sharing among multiple people cannot improve overall performance or reduce the impact of \"leechers\" (i.e., users intentionally consuming bandwidth). In fact, sharing bandwidth among multiple people can lead to increased congestion, decreased performance, and potential network instability.","318":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Someone who is actively attacking with a headbutt will try to strike with the forehead, and aim for specific target areas. The nose, for instance.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence would be:\n\n\"Someone who is actively attacking with a headbutt will try to strike with the forehead, and aim for the temples.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the nose is not a primary target for a headbutt, as it is a more delicate area and can be easily bruised or broken.","319":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\n\"people with autism usually take less risk and need more safety and regularity in their lives to function, so crime would drive them mad.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"people with autism usually have less risk and need more safety and structure in their lives to function, so crime would drive them away.\"\n\nThis is because autism is characterized by difficulties with social interaction, communication, and sensory integration, not a lack of risk-taking or drive.","320":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"The outermost layers may be gases that are mostly invisible to the human eye as hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, etc are on Earth.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the actual composition of the outermost layers of gas giants is not mostly hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen. The actual composition can vary greatly, but the most common gases found in the outer layers of gas giants include hydrogen, helium, and heavier elements like methane, ammonia, and water.","321":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If I received a bite closer to a large vein, or in a particular area, would it itch or swell more?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"If I received a bite in a particular area, it would itch more, or in a location with more blood vessels, it would swell more.\"","322":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If you are an object free of any other interaction and you are around the planet, you will also follow something that we call a geodesic - which is the extrapolation of the concept of \"shortest path\" for an arbitrary geometry.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because according to General Relativity, a geodesic is actually the shortest path for an object in a curved spacetime, not the shortest path for an arbitrary geometry.","323":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Depending on the site, there's additional fun insofar as dead microbes are usually great food for live ones.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Depending on the site, there's additional benefits insofar as dead microbes are usually great food for live ones.\"\n\nThe word \"fun\" is incorrect here as it implies a positive or enjoyable aspect, whereas the correct phrase \"benefits\" suggests a neutral or positive outcome.","324":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"**You were probably vaccinated against MMR, polio, and other diseases.  You may not have detectable antibodies, but that doesn't mean your immune system can't fight them off if exposed.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The correct statement is that the immune system retains dormant B and T cells after vaccination, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are still alive.\n* The immune system can still produce antibodies in response to vaccination, even if they are not detectable in the blood.\n* Vaccination does not directly affect the immune system's ability to fight off diseases that have already been vaccinated.","325":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The moon is gradually getting closer and the sun is gradually getting smaller, so eventually they will be even closer in size.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the sun and the moon are actually getting closer to each other in size due to the moon's orbit around the Earth, not the other way around. The moon is gradually moving closer to the Earth, which is causing the sun to appear smaller in the sky.","326":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"cells don't just add exogenous phospholipids to their membranes.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"cells add exogenous phospholipids to their membranes.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- The cell membrane is not made of phospholipids; it is composed of a phospholipid bilayer.\n- Phospholipids are not added to the cell membrane but are instead synthesized by the cell itself.\n- The cell membrane needs a specific composition of phospholipids, which are synthesized and transported to the membrane through endocytosis, a process that involves the cell engulfing and internalizing substances, including phospholipids.","327":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Life was mostly microscopic, with algal mats and stromatolites in interdidal zones.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Life was mostly microscopic, with algal mats and stromatolites in shallow, tropical zones.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct statement is that in the Precambrian era, the Earth was solid and covered in ice, not that life was mostly microscopic. The Precambrian era is divided into three eons: Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic, and during the Hadean era, the Earth was solid and covered in ice, not life.","328":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Contracted irises mean more absorption of light which means more precise vision in general.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Contracted irises mean less absorption of light which means less precise vision in general.\"","329":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"We sit in one ourselves so this can be taken into account as well.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"We sit in one of the galaxies so this can be taken into account as well.\"","330":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Seeing as the egg itself is semi-permeable?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Seeing as the egg has a semi-permeable membrane\"\n\nExplanation: The eggshell is semi-permeable, allowing water and oxygen to pass through, but not allowing bacteria to pass through.","331":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"electrons are charged\"","332":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"How many times\"\n\nExplanation: The correct sentence should be \"How many minutes\" because the body can only hold a certain amount of oxygen in the lungs before the brain experiences oxygen deprivation, leading to unconsciousness.","333":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The weight of the iron literally flattens them out, removing the wrinkles.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"The weight of the iron causes the fibers to flatten.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct explanation is that heat from the iron causes the fibers to relax and become more malleable, allowing the wrinkles to be removed. When the iron is removed, the fibers cool and contract, which causes them to become rigid and hold their original shape, retaining the wrinkles.","334":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"E and B fields mix into each other.\"","335":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If they do not have an electric charge and do not decay in the detector, all we see is an imbalance in momentum: The total momentum orthogonal to the beams should be zero.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, according to the principles of special relativity, the total momentum of a system is always conserved, regardless of whether the particles involved are charged or not. If a particle decays, its momentum would be redistributed among its decay products, and the total momentum would not remain zero.","336":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"One might ask, then, if it could form a *dwarf* planet \u2026\"","337":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"The relationship between turns and efficiency should really just be driven by the resistance of the wire, the air or other core doesn't 'care' if a field is created by a higher current or more turns, it's behavior remains the same all the way through saturation.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\nThe relationship between turns and efficiency is directly related to the resistance of the wire, the air or other core, and the magnetic field strength.","338":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n* \"Because the main determining factor in their spread of genes is through their parent (ie the queen)\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the queen is the primary factor in the spread of genes, which is not true. The queen's role in the colony is to lay eggs and ensure the colony's survival, but the actual process of gene spread is primarily driven by the colony's social hierarchy and interactions among individuals, particularly the dominant individuals.","339":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If your speed is constant then there will be no change in the asteroid's rotation when you started walking, and it would remain at that rotation even after you stopped.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"If your speed is constant, then there will be no change in the asteroid's rotation when you started walking, and it will remain at that rotation even after you stopped.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe angular momentum of an object is conserved in a closed system, which means that if the initial conditions are the same, the final state will be the same. In this case, the initial state is the asteroid in motion, and the final state is the asteroid at rest. Since the initial conditions are constant, there will be no change in the asteroid's rotation, and it will remain at that rotation.","340":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"immediatly after a heart attack can be very effective if the blockage in the coronary arteries is caused by a blood clot.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"immediately after a heart attack can be very effective if the blockage in the coronary arteries is caused by a blood clot.\"\n\nThe reason for this error is that aspirin can actually cause blood to thicken and form clots, rather than making them more slippery and less likely to form.","341":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"However, more often, they just make it viscous, like a bowl of spaghetti.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because rubber is not viscous like a bowl of spaghetti. Rubber is elastic and can stretch, whereas spaghetti is a type of food that is non-elastic and prone to breaking.","342":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"One of my fave Richard Feynman stories is how we also underestimate our sense of smell -- he had a colleague hold a book in his hand for a minute or so, before putting it back into the bookcase.\"\n\nThe correct answer is: \"One of my fave Richard Feynman stories is how we also underestimate our sense of smell -- he had a colleague hold a book in his hand for a minute or so, before putting it back into the bookcase.","343":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Most are types of Coronaviruses (mostly affect the nose)\"\n\nThe common cold is caused by viruses that affect the respiratory system, not the nose.","344":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Neurologist and neuroscientist here.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that there is a single expert, neurologist and neuroscientist, who can diagnose and treat all cases of depression. However, the correct response would be that there is no single expert, and treatment for depression often involves a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and other healthcare professionals.","345":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If our immune system fails to do this, and say, a bunch of ameba start eating your brain, then you typically become dead very quickly and then your immune system stops working together.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"If our immune system fails to do this, then you typically become dead very quickly and then your immune system stops working together.\"","346":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"As you hold your breath you are unconsciously increasing the pressure in your lungs.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because when you hold your breath, your diaphragm relaxes, allowing your lungs to expand and fill with air. This increase in lung volume would decrease the pressure inside the lungs, not increase it.","347":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If you heat this magnet again, the high kinetic energy causes the atoms to align even further, thus strengthening the magnetic fields, and the material becomes more magnetic.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\"If you heat this magnet again, the high kinetic energy causes the atoms to align even further, thus weakening the magnetic fields, and the material becomes less magnetic.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that when a ferromagnetic material is heated, the alignment of its atoms is disrupted, and the magnetic field strength decreases.","348":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"For instance, you can lift a sled up a ramp, using chemical energy from your food to do work on the sled, and adding potential energy from gravity, and then release the sled, converting potential energy into kinetic energy in the motion of the sled, and thermal kinetic energy from friction (or kinetic energy in the form of sound, energy added to the air around the sled, etc.).\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence is: \"For instance, you can lift a sled up a ramp, using chemical energy from your food to do work on the sled, and adding potential energy from gravity, and then releasing the sled, converting potential energy into kinetic energy in the motion of the sled.\"","349":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Some cheating individuals have been observed.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Some cheaters have been observed.\"","350":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It wasn't really until WW2 \/ the 1940's and the era of the pin-up girl that shaving legs became the fashion.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"It wasn't really until after the 1940's and the era of the pin-up girl that shaving legs became the fashion.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* WW2 refers to World War 2, not WW2, which is a historical event that occurred in 1939-1945.\n* The era of the pin-up girl refers to the 1940s, not the 1940s. The term \"era\" is a unit of time that typically refers to a specific period of history, whereas \"the\" is a definite article that indicates a specific noun.","351":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"When you're looking at it on an atomic level, what makes atoms (or nuclei) unable to intersect with one another?\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\"When you're looking at it on a macroscopic level, what makes atoms (or nuclei) unable to intersect with one another?\"\n\nExplanation:\n- At the atomic level, the interaction between atoms is governed by the electromagnetic force, not the electrostatic force. The electrostatic force is a long-range force that acts between charged particles, while the electromagnetic force is a short-range force that acts between charged particles. At the atomic level, the electromagnetic force is too weak to overcome the attractive force between atoms, so atoms are not able to intersect.\n- At the macroscopic level, the electrostatic force between atoms is strong enough to overcome the attractive force between atoms, so atoms can intersect.","352":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Modern TGs are 100% efficient at best.\"\n\nThe correct sentence would be:\n\"Modern thermoelectric generators (TGs) are 100% efficient at best.\"\n\nThe reason for the incorrect statement is that thermoelectric generators (TGs) are not 100% efficient, but rather they are highly efficient.","353":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It is the primary pharmacological tolerance mechanism.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"It is the primary pharmacological tolerance mechanism is the development of more adenosine receptor sites.\"","354":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"You're asking two different questions.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the speaker is asking two separate questions, which is not the case. The speaker is actually asking about both antibodies and chemotaxis.","355":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"The joints of the fingers have cartilage and on the surface of that cartilage is a protein called lubricin.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \n\"The joints of the fingers have cartilage and on the surface of that cartilage is a lubricin.\"","356":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If you mean redshift due to a doppler effect, then energy is still conserved *in an inertial reference frame*.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because in general relativity, the conservation of energy is not a property of an inertial reference frame. In general relativity, the energy of an object is not conserved in the same way it is in special relativity.","357":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"This is not a major cause of the loss of SAV beds in many areas, as eutrophication decreases the prevalence and growth rate of said algae.\"\n\nCorrected Answer: Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) actually has a very hard time dealing with epiphytic algae growing on them, as they are outcompeted for light.","358":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"In terms of expansion, we can barely see any objects outside of our galaxy with the naked eye (just a few fuzzy blobs).\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"In terms of expansion, we can barely see any objects outside of our galaxy with the naked eye, except for a few fuzzy blobs.\"","359":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"these perturb low lunar orbits, causing satellites to impact the surface typically within under 2 years.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the Moon's gravity is not uniform and has significant \"mascons\" (mass concentration) that cause satellites to be perturbed out of their orbits and impact the surface, not within a short period of time.","360":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It depends on the injury and the presentation.\"\n\nThe correct answer is \"It depends on the injury and the duration of the inflammation.\"","361":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Typical systems will support life for about eight hours.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the correct answer should be that the life support systems will support life for about 8 hours, not 8 days.","362":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Time-symmetry is recovered only under certain approximations.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the second law of thermodynamics, not the concept of time-symmetry, is related to the concept of entropy and the direction of time in the universe. The second law states that the total entropy of an isolated system will always increase over time, which is a fundamental principle in thermodynamics.","363":"Factually incorrect sentence: \"You cannot build some tolerance of uv at the wavelengths that do damage to your skin by producing more melanin which acts as a sunscreen of sorts.\"\n\nCorrected answer: \nQuestion: Is it possible to build a tolerance to radiation?\nSpecifically, if a human were to be exposed to small amounts of radiation regularly, could this somehow help the body develop a tolerance to radiation?","364":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The cells produce proteins which attach them to the matrix.\"\n\nThe correct sentence is: \"The cells produce proteins which attach them to the extracellular matrix.\"","365":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Without signals coming from the brain, how does the heart know to increase rate when the muscles and brain require more oxygen during exercise?\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* The heart does have an intrinsic mechanism to regulate its rate through the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is a small group of cells in the right atrium that acts as the heart's natural pacemaker.\n* The SA node generates electrical impulses that travel through the atria and then to the ventricles, causing the heart to beat.\n* During exercise, the body's demand for oxygen increases, and the heart needs to increase its rate to pump more blood and meet the increased oxygen requirements. The increased demand for oxygen is met by an increase in the release of norepinephrine and adrenaline, which stimulates the SA node to generate more electrical impulses and increase the heart rate.\n\nThe factually correct sentence is:\n\n\"Without signals coming from the brain, how does the heart know to increase rate when the muscles and brain require more oxygen during exercise?\"\n\nAnswer: The heart knows to increase rate through the baroreceptors in the walls of the aorta and the carotid arteries, which detect changes in blood pressure and send signals to the brain through the vagus nerve, leading to a decrease in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure.","366":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\nAmmonia has a higher heat capacity yet lower inter molecular bond strengths when compared to water.\n\nCorrected answer: \n\nThe factually correct sentence is:\n\nHeat capacity is determined by the number of energy states (vibrational, rotational, kinetic etc) to raise the temperature.","367":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"flash memory makers do not 'die stacking' where they take flash chips and physically stack them on top of each other, adding tiny wire interconnects later.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because \"die stacking\" is a term typically used in the context of semiconductor manufacturing, referring to the process of stacking multiple layers of silicon wafers to increase the density of integrated circuits. In the context of flash memory, \"die stacking\" is not a relevant term, and the sentence is likely a mistranslation or misinterpretation of the term \"stacking\".","368":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"There is an oxidizer present in the lines, and thus a flame can travel through them.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because gas lines do not typically contain an oxidizer. The correct answer should mention a combustible gas, which is a gas that can sustain a fire or explosion.","369":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Episodic memory doesn't tend to appear until roughly (and controversially) around age 3, yet it is an important foundation of what we mean when we say adults \"know\" things as opposed to simply being able to perform skills unconsciously.\"\n\nCorrected Answer: Infants don't \"know\" things in the *same* sense that adults do, but they certainly are driven to try new age-appropriate things, and are happy when they succeed at them, in each successive stage.","370":"Factually correct answer:\nWhy do bladeless wind turbines have to be spaced out?\nThey are still disturbing and slowing the wind - they have to, otherwise they wouldn't be able to extract energy.","371":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\n\"anything at one of those points that drifts away from it tends to keep drifting farther.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that anything that drifts away from the L2 point will be pulled away further, which contradicts the fact that L2 is negatively stable and should not collect dust or rocks.","372":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"We get most of our heat from the sun, but I think the temperature of the crust goes up by 25 degrees celsius for every kilometer or two if you dig down.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\"We get most of our heat from the sun, but I think the temperature of the crust goes up by 25 degrees Celsius for every kilometer.\"\n\nThe factually correct statement is that the temperature of the crust increases by 25\u00b0C for every kilometer.","373":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"They're typically heat-killed, which denatures the viral proteins and prevents them from completely hijacking your cells as a normal, non-damaged virus would.\"\n\nThe correct answer would be: \"They're typically inactivated, which denatures the viral proteins and prevents them from completely hijacking your cells as a normal, non-damaged virus would.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- \"Heat-killed\" is correct as it means the viruses are killed by heat.\n- \"Denatures\" is correct as it means the viral proteins are changed in shape to prevent them from performing their normal functions.\n- \"Hijacking your cells\" is correct as it is a common term used to describe how viruses infect and take control of host cells.\n- \"Normal, non-damaged virus\" is correct as it refers to the typical state of the virus before it is killed.\n- \"Would\" is incorrect as it is a linking verb that is used to form the conditional tense, whereas \"are\" is the correct subject-verb agreement in this context.","374":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\"When it is observed\/not observed,\"","375":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Since most of the gases build up in the final stretch, called the large intestine (which way shorter than the small intestine, but a bit wider)\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Since most of the gases build up in the final stretch, called the small intestine\"","376":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"But selection pressures always operate independently.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"But selection pressures operate independently.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct sentence states that selection pressures operate independently, which is a fundamental principle of evolutionary biology. This is a correct statement.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence suggests that selection pressures operate independently, which is not accurate. Selection pressures are often correlated with each other, as they can influence different traits and lead to different outcomes. This is not a correct statement, as different species often have different selection pressures operating independently.\n\nThe correct sentence \"But selection pressures operate independently\" is a correct statement.","377":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"When this is slow, this is 1\/2 mv^2 so you could write the whole thing as mc^2  + 1\/2 mv^2.\"\n\nThis sentence contains an error in the exponentiation. The correct exponentiation should be (mc^2)^2, not (mc^2) + 1\/2 mv^2.\n\nCorrected sentence: \"When this is slow, this is (mc^2)^2 so you could write the whole thing as mc^2 + (pc)^2.\"","378":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"If you imagine sitting in some inertial frame, watching the Earth rotate around its own axis (and revolving around the sun, if you want), you would see the angular momentum of the gyroscope remaining fixed.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \n\"If you imagine sitting in some inertial frame, watching the Earth rotate around its own axis.\"","379":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Not perfectly transferred, but enough that for instance weather fronts are a bigger factor.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the transfer of momentum from the Earth to the plane is sufficient to cause weather fronts, which is not the case. The transfer of momentum is negligible compared to the momentum carried by the winds in the atmosphere, which is what drives weather patterns.","380":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"that's still within the atmosphere by any reasonable definition, but it's higher than the space shuttle flew, so call it what you like.\"\n\nThe correct sentence would be:\n\n\"That's still within the atmosphere by any reasonable definition, but it's higher than the space shuttle flew.\"\n\nThe reason for the mistake is that the space shuttle, which is a spacecraft, can fly higher than 300 miles in the atmosphere. However, nuclear bombs are typically detonated at much lower altitudes, such as underwater or in the atmosphere, due to the intense heat generated by the nuclear reaction.","381":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Vitamins, essential amino acids, potassium, calcium, iron, ect.\"","382":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It could say that yes urban animals in an urban setting are usually at carrying capacity.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"It could say that urban animals in an urban setting are usually at carrying capacity.\"","383":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There has been no evidence saying that sagging is controlled by wearing a bra.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because there is evidence that wearing a bra can actually contribute to breast sagging or loss of breast tissue, particularly in women who wear them for extended periods or have a history of breast surgery.","384":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Taking the battery out while plugged in, etc.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because leaving a charged battery unpluged is actually recommended to help it recover from deep discharge and prevent damage.","385":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"the number of loops required just becomes a smaller set of infinity.\"\n\nCorrected Answer: \n Is it possible to extract a data series' singal-to-noise ratio, if we don't have any prior information about the shape or magnitute of the signal, and the only thing we know about the noise is that it's completely random (not even a guess about its magnitude)?","386":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"Its not that they're growing longer per se, they're growing for more time.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \n\"Its not that they're growing longer per se, they're growing for their entire lives.\"","387":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If we really wanted to (i.e. had the political will to spend the money) and had enough lead time we could grab it.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that it's not feasible to intercept the alien probe because of a lack of resources and time, but the factually correct sentence would be:\n\n\"If we really wanted to intercept it, we could grab it.\"\n\nThe correct sentence is factual because it directly states that the probe can be intercepted, which is the correct outcome of the scenario.","388":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It would DRAMATICALLY increase the complexity of moving for very little benefit.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be \"It would dramatically increase the complexity of moving.\"","389":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"My brain is full of confusion\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the speaker's brain is the cause of their confusion, which is not the case. The speaker is simply expressing their confusion about the concept of light.","390":"1. Why 1^\u221e is undetermined? Why is it not 1?","391":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The antennas on a cell phone tower are very small so they can pick up weaker signals.\"\n\nCorrected Answer: The antennas on a cell phone tower are very strong so they can pick up stronger signals.","392":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"All electronics radiate energy in form of electromagnetic waves.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"All electronics emit energy in form of electromagnetic waves.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct sentence should be accurate. Electrons in an electric circuit do indeed emit electromagnetic waves, but the statement that the cables in the cockpit are designed to act as an antenna is incorrect. The reason for this is not because the cables are acting as antennas, but rather because they are used to transmit signals from the cockpit to other parts of the plane, such as the autopilot system.","393":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It doesn't matter how big your earthquake is if the only component of movement is strike-slip (i.e. horizontal) because it's not going to displace any water.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because a tsunami is caused by a vertical displacement of water, not horizontal movement.","394":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's the main method for spider dispersal.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence should be:\n\n\"It's the main method for dispersal.\"","395":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There are just too many factors.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"There are just a few factors.\"","396":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"such reactions cannot happen at lower temperatures.\"\n\nThe correct answer would be:\n\"such reactions cannot happen at higher temperatures.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe Maillard reaction is a complex process that occurs between amino acids and reducing sugars in the presence of heat, not just at lower temperatures. It involves the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones, resulting in the formation of new compounds with distinct flavors, aromas, and colors. While it is true that the Maillard reaction is more pronounced at higher temperatures, it can still occur at lower temperatures, especially when combined with the presence of certain microorganisms. However, the Maillard reaction is not just a single reaction, as it involves a complex series of chemical reactions that can occur at various temperatures.","397":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"long-term care facilities housing high-risk elderly patients didn't do a good job with isolation, leading to a lot of deaths.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the statement about long-term care facilities not doing a good job with isolation is not supported by factual evidence. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other health organizations have emphasized the importance of proper isolation and quarantine protocols in preventing the spread of COVID-19, including in long-term care facilities.\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"long-term care facilities housing high-risk elderly patients had inadequate infection control measures in place, leading to a significant number of deaths.\"\n\nThis corrected sentence is supported by factual evidence and is a well-documented issue in the response to the pandemic.","398":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\n\"If someone could explain the whole phenomenon a little bit more I'd appreciate.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the person needs to be explained the phenomenon in more detail, which is not the case. The correct sentence should simply state \"I'd appreciate\" or \"I'd like to know more\" to show understanding or interest.","399":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"I figure I would ask the science people to take a shot at explaining this one.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the speaker is asking a question to the science community, which implies that they are seeking expert advice or opinions from a group of experts. The correct sentence should be:\n\n\"I would ask the science people to explain this one.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should also be:\n\n\"I would ask the experts to explain this one.\"","400":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Secondly, the Atlantic is shrinking (South America and Africa are moving towards each other)\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Secondly, the Atlantic is moving towards South America and Africa, so the newly formed ocean bottom as this happens is at the bottom of the ocean.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean is actually moving towards Africa and South America, not the other way around. This process is known as continental drift, where two tectonic plates are moving apart, resulting in the formation of new oceanic crust and the creation of new land.","401":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"The heart starts as two lateral tubes that fuse together.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the heart actually starts as a tube-like structure called a tube heart, which develops into a more complex organ with chambers and valves.","402":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Can anyone explain to the layman what physicists mean when they say something comes from nothing?\"\n\nCorrected sentence:\n\"Can anyone explain to the layman what physicists mean when they say something comes from nothing?\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct explanation is not provided in the given answer.","403":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"The PCR tests defect for other, more specific genetic materials in COVID, and therefore don't test positive for vaccines.\"\n\nCorrected answer: The factually correct sentence is: \"The PCR tests defect for more specific genetic materials in COVID, and therefore don't test positive for vaccines.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- The PCR tests do test for the genetic material of COVID, not just the spike protein.\n- The spike protein is indeed produced by mRNA vaccines, which are the type of vaccine mentioned in the question.\n- The PCR test is a molecular test that can detect genetic material, not just the spike protein.\n- mRNA vaccines are designed to produce a specific protein (the spike protein) in the cells, which is what the PCR test is designed to detect.","404":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Idk if I explained my question well, please help?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"I don't know if I explained my question well, please help?\"\n\nAnalysis:\nThe given answer contains several inaccuracies:\n\n1.

The statement that NaCl molecules stay intact and separate from each other when heated is incorrect. At the melting point, the NaCl molecules do break apart and turn into a liquid of Na and Cl.\n3. The mention of covalent bonds is incorrect. Ionic bonds are the type of chemical bond that holds NaCl molecules together, not covalent bonds.\n4. The mention of \"the solution structure of ionic liquids\" is also incorrect. Ionic liquids are typically composed of ions, not a lattice structure.","405":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Would telling somebody 100 lightyears away a fact instantaneously be considered time travel?\"\n\nCorrected answer: \nReading Card's *Speaker for the Dead* right now, and as always the ansible (a device allowing instantaneous communication across an infinite distance) and the buggers' methods of communication are key plot devices.\n\nWikipedia claims that communication faster than light would violate causality as stated by special relativity, but doesn't go into much better detail. So why would faster-than-light communication violate causality?","406":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"There\u2019s a neat little desk toy (that is super expensive) that is based off of this idea. I can\u2019t remember what it was called, though...\"\n\nThe factually incorrect statement is that the answer is a \"desk toy\" and it is \"super expensive\". Desk toys are typically inexpensive and not expensive.","407":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"There's the problem of gravitational gradient leading to tidal forces.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"There's the problem of gravitational gradient leading to tidal forces on a black hole.\"\n\nThe reason is that a black hole is a region of spacetime where the gravitational field is so strong that it warps the fabric of spacetime, causing tidal forces to occur. The term \"tidal forces\" refers to the gravitational forces that act on objects that are in the vicinity of a black hole, causing them to be stretched and squeezed in the direction of the gravitational field.","408":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Plus JWST will work in ultraviolet which is much more advantageous for seeing through dust clouds.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is actually designed to operate in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, not ultraviolet.","409":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Your dad saw this and decided not to even listen to whatever you were going to say about \"g.\"\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\n\"Your dad saw this and decided not to even listen to whatever you were going to say about g.\"\n\nThe reason is that the correct answer does not mention anything about the convergence of the sum, which is not a relevant aspect of the original question. The original question is about assigning variables to infinite sums, but the factually wrong sentence implies that the original question was about the convergence of a specific sum, which is not the case.","410":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"There was lightning everywhere but then I realized I had no idea if I was safe or not in my little metal box of a car.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the correct phrase should be \"There was lightning everywhere\" to indicate that lightning was present, not \"in\" your car.","411":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"As it reaches the event horizon, its time will be so sped up that the next \"tick\" will happen before the universe began.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement is incorrect because the event horizon is the point of no return around a black hole, and once something crosses the event horizon, it is essentially \"trapped\" within the black hole's gravity and is not able to escape.\n- The concept of time \"beginning\" is also incorrect because time dilation is a consequence of the strong gravity of a black hole, not a cause of time beginning.\n- The statement also implies that an object can get arbitrarily close to a black hole, which is not true; the event horizon marks the point of no return, and objects are not able to escape once they cross it.","412":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"At 97F the air around you is barely conducting any heat from your body, but down at 70F it feels just right.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the relationship between temperature and heat conduction is not directly proportional. At 97F, the air is not conducting heat away from the body, it's just that the air is not moving as much. At 70F, the air is moving more, which helps to dissipate heat away from the body.","413":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"When we are young, we have lots of an enzyme called catalase that breaks the peroxide down into water and oxygen, before it can oxidize important cellular components.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because catalase is actually an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, not hydrogen peroxide. The statement about breaking down peroxide into water and oxygen is correct, but the enzyme catalase is actually involved in breaking down hydrogen peroxide, not hydrogen peroxide.","414":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"botox\/surgery\"","415":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Hot air rises\"","416":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"plasma spicules on the Sun are not much cooler than that, to give an example.\"\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the surface temperature of the Sun is actually about 5,500 degrees Celsius, not 1,000,000 degrees.","417":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"People often mistakenly assume the binding energy is the energy required to \"bind\" the nucleons together, in fact it is the energy released when you bind the nucleons together.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the binding energy is a measure of the energy required to hold the nucleons (protons and neutrons) together, not the energy released when they are bound.","418":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"And are there there or are there not?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"And are there are there\"","419":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"On the top of the tower, you have the mixing between the vapour and the cold outside air.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"On the top of the tower, you have the mixing of the vapour with the cold outside air.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the mixing of the vapour with the cold outside air is not the reason for the increasing radius of the cooling tower.","420":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"All I can find is [this portion](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YasCQRAWRwU) of the system.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: \"All I can find is the YouTube video.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence is: \"All I can find is the YouTube video.\"","421":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Pycnopodia helianthoides (Sunflower star) have been especially hard hit in many areas\"","422":"The factually incorrect sentence is: \"This combination of heat and gas being formed causes pressure pockets underwater, which escape violently causing the iconic explosions.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: \"This combination of heat and gas being formed causes pressure pockets to expand underwater, which escape violently causing the iconic explosions.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The statement \"This combination of heat and gas being formed causes pressure pockets underwater\" is incorrect. The correct statement should be \"This combination of heat and gas being formed causes pressure pockets to expand underwater.\"\n* The phrase \"iconic explosions\" is also incorrect. The correct phrase should be \"iconic explosions\" (note the correct spelling of \"iconic\" as a single word).\n* The sentence structure and the use of \"explosions\" instead of \"expanding\" is also incorrect. The correct sentence should be \"This combination of heat and gas being formed causes pressure pockets to expand underwater.\"","423":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Cells do not contain endogenous RNAses, and the short lifespan of RNA is not an advantage of mRNA vaccines.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Cells do contain endogenous RNAses, and the short lifespan of RNA is an advantage of mRNA vaccines.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The correct statement is that cells contain endogenous RNAses, which are RNAs that are naturally produced by the cell.\n* The factually correct statement is that the short lifespan of RNA is an advantage of mRNA vaccines, as it allows for the rapid production and degradation of the vaccine, making it more effective and efficient.","424":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Well, if a material is bonded to itself really strongly (tungsten), it will take a lot of energy (heat) to force them to spread out.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\"Intermolecular bonding energy.\"\n\nThe correct sentence is related to the coefficient of linear expansion, which is a property of materials that describes how they expand or contract in response to changes in temperature or pressure. The coefficient of linear expansion is a measure of how much a material expands or contracts per unit length when it is heated or cooled.","425":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Dizzyness\/fainting\/dark vision, is usually a sign of the brain not getting enough oxygen.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Dizzyness\/fainting\/dark vision, is usually a sign of low blood pressure.\"","426":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If it were hotter, and be \"white hot,\" it would be radiating energy, as light, with higher frequencies, too, into the blue end of the spectrum.\"\n\nThe correct statement should be:\n\"If it were hotter, it would be radiating energy, as light, with higher frequencies, into the red end of the spectrum.\"","427":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Ultracold gasses can display some bizarre properties.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\n\"Superconductivity.\"\n\nHere is the corrected answer without changes:\n\nAre there any macroscopic examples of quantum behavior?\nTitle pretty much sums it up. I'm curious to see if there are entire systems that exhibit quantum characteristics. I read Feynman's QED lectures and it got my curiosity going wild.\nEdit: Woah!! What an amazing response this has gotten! I've been spending all day having my mind blown. Thanks for being so awesome r\/askscience","428":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"You cannot carefully guide the beam onto a piece of material called a \"viewer\" and watch it through a camera.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) is not a device that allows direct observation of the beam's physical appearance, but rather a complex machine that accelerates protons to nearly the speed of light and then collides them into each other. The \"viewers\" are actually high-speed cameras that capture the beam's interactions with the materials it encounters, not the beam itself.","429":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Some of these conditions can still occur in the vacuum and extreme temperatures of space, so decomposition to an extent can still occur but it is considerably more likely that without protection the majority of fluids in the body would escape as vapor (I'll leave how to your imagination)\"\n\nThis sentence contains an error: \"I'll leave how to your imagination\" should be \"I'll leave how to your imagination\" (a contraction of \"I will leave how to your imagination\", which is a grammatically correct expression).","430":"Factually incorrect sentence: \"This is generally cooled via gravitational shockwaves, as the gas falls into the massive gravitational potential of the cluster.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that the gas between galaxies is \"generally cooled via gravitational shockwaves\" is factually incorrect. Gravitational shockwaves are not responsible for cooling the gas, but rather heating it.\n- The statement that \"the gas falls into the massive gravitational potential of the cluster\" is also factually incorrect. Galaxies are not falling into the gravitational potential of a cluster; rather, the cluster's gravitational potential is exerting a force on the surrounding gas, causing it to be accelerated.","431":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Photons do decay; they are not all stable.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because photons are actually stable particles, not unstable. Photons are a fundamental particle in physics, and they do not decay or change energy over time. They are a fundamental aspect of the electromagnetic force and play a crucial role in various physical phenomena.","432":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"UV light has a lower wavelength (higher photon energy).\"\n\nThe correct statement is that UV light has a shorter wavelength (lower photon energy).","433":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Does the fat combust or melt?\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Does the fat burn?\"","434":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Once the moon passed by, the elliptic would still be aimed at the moon and would remain a figure-8.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because, in a figure-8 orbit, the moon would not be aimed at the Earth, but rather at the moon.","435":"Factually correct sentence: The main problem with a hand-portable laser right now is the power supply.

However, when the frame of reference is moving relative to the speed of light, the laws of physics are not the same for all observers. This is known as the Lorentz transformation.\n\nIn the given sentence, the idea that the neutron's velocity can change from one frame of reference to another is incorrect. The neutron's velocity remains constant in all inertial frames of reference. The correct statement should be:\n\"If, in one frame of reference, there is a fast proton hitting a slow neutron, then there is another frame of reference in which the neutron is fast and the proton is slow.\"\n\nThe correct analysis is that, according to special relativity, the neutron's velocity remains constant in all inertial frames of reference.","438":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If mankind were able to meetup with life intelligent life outside of earth it seems that communicating with them wouldn't be much different than communicating with dolphins.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"If mankind were able to meet with intelligent life outside of earth, it seems that communicating with them wouldn't be much different than communicating with dolphins.\"","439":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Your center of mass cannot be changed by moving the relative position of body parts.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that the center of mass can be changed by changing the relative position of body parts, which is not true. The center of mass is a fixed point that is determined by the distribution of mass within the body, and it cannot be changed by altering the relative position of individual body parts.","440":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's like if you were to put a blanket over a stereo - it sounds different, but everything would still be in the same key.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"It's like if you were to put a blanket over a piano - it sounds different, but everything would still be in the same key.\"","441":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"it isn't toxic\"","442":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"even more things become possible\"\n\nThis sentence implies that the particles can become more than two particles, which is not true in the context of the question. The correct answer should be \"even more than two particles\" is not the only possibility, but the question is asking about what happens when a particle meets antimatter that is not its antiparticle, e.g. a proton with a positron, and the possible outcomes.","443":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Did the light do a u-turn? Did it pause in place for a billion years so it could travel with light from the resulting galaxy?\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the universe is expanding, and galaxies are moving away from each other. The light from galaxies would not be able to travel back in time to the era when the galaxies formed. The expansion of the universe would mean that galaxies are moving away from us, not towards each other.","444":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If it's the nasal spray vaccine, in that case it uses attenuated viruses (meaning live ones, but a strain that doesn't cause disease).\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"If it's the nasal spray vaccine, in that case it uses inactivated viruses.\"","445":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Also ADHD is more pronounced in kids because they spend the most of their time in a structured environment and as they grow up they typically pursue and maintain careers where their diagnosis does not hold them back as much.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because ADHD is not necessarily more pronounced in kids, and the statement that it is more pronounced in kids is not supported by any credible medical or scientific evidence. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals of all ages, and its severity and impact can vary widely from person to person.","446":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Pesticides are often washed away by rain which is often part of the guidelines for use - rain can shorten the preharvest interval that is needed before crops can be harvested.\"\n\nThe correct sentence would be:\n\n\"Pesticides are washed away by rain which is often part of the guidelines for use - rain can shorten the preharvest interval that is needed before crops can be harvested.\"","447":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Scientists have fully understood how birds learn to sing.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: \"Scientists have understood how birds learn to sing.\"","448":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"tens of thousands of years old\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"thousands of years\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the correct timeframe for leaves that are tens of thousands of years old is indeed tens of thousands of years, not thousands of years.","449":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"They provide 4, 4 and 9 calories per gram, respectively.\"\n\nThe correct information is that 1 gram of carbohydrates provides 4 calories, 1 gram of proteins provides 4 calories, and 1 gram of fats provides 9 calories.","450":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Helium was first discovered as an absorption line in the sun which didn't match any known element so it was named Helios.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because helium was actually discovered in 1868 by William Ramsay and Morris Travers, and it was initially thought to be a noble gas. However, when they observed that helium emitted light when excited by a hot filament, they realized it was not a noble gas, and it was later named after the Greek god of the sun.","451":"Factually correct sentence: \nM87 is not oriented towards us so that the center of the galaxy is easily viewed and M87 is not home to a truly gargantuan black hole that is not actively consuming material and not producing brilliant jets of material radiating away from the \"north\" and \"south\" poles of the galaxy.\n\nThe factually incorrect sentence is:\n\"The center of the galaxy is easily viewed and M87 is not home to a truly gargantuan black hole that is not actively consuming material and not producing brilliant jets of material radiating away from the \"north\" and \"south\" poles of the galaxy.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should have stated that the center of the galaxy is not visible because M87 is not actively emitting strong radiation, but rather, it is not visible because the radiation is coming from the galactic plane itself, not from the supermassive black hole.","452":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Although, if the density of supermassive black holes is actually pretty low.\"\n\nThis sentence contains the incorrect statement that supermassive black holes have a high density, which contradicts the fact that supermassive black holes are actually extremely dense objects with masses millions or even billions of times that of the sun.","453":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Just thinkin' 'bout how people say we didn't land on the moon n stuff.\"\n\nThis sentence contains the incorrect word \"n\" instead of \"on\".","454":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Of course, using them excessively in speech can be distracting, and probably should be avoided.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that using filler words like \"um\", \"you know\", and \"uh\" is inherently distracting and should be avoided, which is not a universally accepted linguistic principle.","455":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Because they aren't gliding they can't get the aerodynamic benefits that geese do by flying in a V, and navigation in hummingbirds is (as far as we know) hard-wired instead of learned so following the group isn't as important.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be \"Because they aren't gliding they can't get the aerodynamic benefits that geese do by flying in a V, and navigation in hummingbirds is hard-wired instead of learned.\"","456":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"whisk(e)ys and other liquors are distilled to concentrate the alcohol\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be \"whisk(e)s are distilled to concentrate the alcohol\".","457":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Not shivering is not a good idea.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Not shivering is not a good idea, but it is actually a good idea.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe sentence is incorrect because it implies that not shivering is a bad idea, which is not true. In fact, shivering is a natural response to cold temperatures, and it does help to generate heat. However, the other sentence is correct, as it points out that shivering can actually cause the body to lose heat, making it a bad idea to do it intentionally.","458":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"In this process, the particles belonging to the mirror surface are knocked into a higher energy state, which almost immediately collapses back to the ground level, emitting a completely new photon.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"In this process, the particles belonging to the mirror surface are knocked into a lower energy state, which almost immediately collapses back to the ground level, emitting a completely new photon.\"\n\nThe reason for the incorrect sentence is that it incorrectly states that the particles are knocked into a higher energy state, which is not the case. Photons always lose energy as they interact with matter, not gain energy.","459":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"At absolute zero, molecular activity increases, and since combustion is a reaction involving excitation, fire as we know it can exist at absolute zero.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"At absolute zero, molecular activity decreases, and since combustion is a reaction involving excitation, fire as we know it cannot exist at absolute zero.\"\n\nThe correct statement is that at absolute zero, molecular activity decreases, not increases.","460":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It has to do with how the internal mechanism and spring is aligned.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\n\"It has to do with the type of fasteners being tightened.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\n\"Using a click type torque wrench both directions will actually decrease its accuracy more quickly over time\"","461":"The factually wrong sentence is: \n\"It's because a small portion of the infalling matter is not ejected at highly relativistic velocity.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the accretion disk around a black hole is actually spinning extremely rapidly, and the matter that falls onto the black hole is not ejected at relativistic velocity.","462":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Boils due to pressure changes.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because humans do not boil due to pressure changes. Boiling is a process that occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, causing it to turn into vapor. Humans do not have the biological mechanism to boil like some aquatic animals, including sperm whales and elephant seals.","463":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"our nose end up getting blocked\" \n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"our nasal mucous membrane gets swollen\"","464":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"who are most responsible for CO2 intake, I presume,\"","465":"Factually incorrect sentence: \"You could impart enough kinetic energy onto something that amount of energy you're referring to it would probably in essence become a fusion bomb as soon as in impacting the earth if not the atoms in the atmosphere beforehand.\"\n\nCorrected sentence: \"You could impart enough kinetic energy onto something that amount of energy you're referring to it would probably in essence become a fusion bomb as soon as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.\"","466":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"There are no types of electromagnetic radiation that can go through a human body.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that there are types of electromagnetic radiation that can pass through the human body, which is not true. There are no known forms of electromagnetic radiation that can penetrate the human body without being absorbed or scattered by the body's tissues.","467":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"we would collide with an object that large.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because Jupiter is a gas giant planet, and it is not massive enough to collide with another planet. The Roche limit is a concept that applies to solid objects, not gas giants like Jupiter.","468":"Factually correct sentence: \"A galaxy does not consist mostly of space.\"\n\nThe incorrect sentence is: \"think about how big our solar system is and the relative size of the sun and planets for that massive volume.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement is incorrect because our solar system is not massive enough to be considered a galaxy. A galaxy is a massive collection of stars, gas, and dust held together by gravity, whereas our solar system is a relatively small, planetary system.\n- The statement also implies that the relative size of the sun and planets in our solar system is comparable to that of a galaxy, which is not the case. The sun is much larger than the planets in our solar system.","469":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"In fact, in a superconductor, you can have a loop of wire with no battery in it but with current flowing.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because in a superconductor, it is not possible to have a loop of wire with no battery in it. A superconductor requires an external power source, typically in the form of a battery, to maintain its superconducting state.","470":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"I think the best way to think of it is that genes set the outer boundaries of intelligence and environment decides where you land on that spectrum.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"I think the best way to think of it is that genes set the boundaries of intelligence and environment decides where you land on that spectrum.\"","471":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Calling it a force in the f=ma sense is misleading, it's better to call it an interaction.\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n\"Calling it a force in the f=ma sense is misleading, it's better to call it an interaction.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe sentence is incorrect because it tries to relate the weak nuclear force to Einstein's famous equation f=ma (Force=mass*acceleration), which is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics. In the context of the weak nuclear force, it is not a force in the classical sense but rather a type of interaction that involves the exchange of particles, such as W and Z bosons, which mediate the weak nuclear force.","472":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"You should see the compass needle not move at all.\"\n\nThe correct explanation is that the compass needle will move because of the changing magnetic field generated by the moving magnet, not because the compass is not moving at all.","473":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"The separation of the southern hemisphere's continents from Antarctica did not cause the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet.\"\n\nCorrected sentence: The separation of the southern hemisphere's continents from Antarctica did not cause the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet.","474":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Nevertheless, since this occurs right at the start of development it can have long lasting consequences.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the Genetic Maternal Effect occurs at the time of fertilization, not the start of development. The Genetic Maternal Effect refers to the genetic material received from the mother during fertilization, which is then passed on to the zygote.","475":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Really, in any number of dimensions, angular momentum is given by an n by n antisymmetric matrix.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because:\n\n* Angular momentum is indeed a pseudovector in three dimensions, not an antisymmetric matrix.\n* The correct statement should be that in any number of dimensions, angular momentum is given by an n by n matrix, not a pseudovector.\n* The correct representation of angular momentum in higher dimensions is a (pseudo)vector, not an antisymmetric matrix.","476":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n* Fatigue: Divert energy use to avoid fighting the infection'\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n* Fatigue: Divert energy use to fight the infection'\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe original sentence implies that the immune system absorbs the infection, which is incorrect. The immune system mounts defenses, not absorbs the infection.","477":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"The calculation for refraction index does not use the second usage of sine.\"\n\nThe correct usage of sine in the equation is indeed the first usage, which is:\n\nn = sin(i) \/ sin(r)\n\nThe second usage of sine is actually the sine of the angle i, which is not directly related to the refractive index.","478":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Sepsis is when this bacteria gets into the blood and the toxins produced by the bacteria prevent fluids from leaking out of blood vessels causing extremely high blood pressures and clear mental status, no fever, and ultimately recovery without intervention.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because urinary tract infections (UTIs) are typically caused by bacteria that are not usually associated with high blood pressure or clear mental status. UTIs are usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) or other gram-negative bacteria, not gram-negative bacteria.","479":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Playing with magnets the force seems to drop off quickly with distance.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the force of magnetism decreases with distance, not the opposite. The force of magnetism decreases with the square of the distance, not linearly.","480":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Bacteria and other organisms do not condense and coagulate their intracellular proteins, allowing the ethanol to penetrate further into the cell wall.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the statement is actually true. Bacteria and other organisms do condense and coagulate their intracellular proteins, which prevents the ethanol from penetrating and effectively killing the organism.","481":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"If someone is hypovolemic enough, they will be able to maintain an adequate blood pressure to supply oxygen to their organs.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because hypovolemic shock is a condition where the body loses too much blood volume, leading to inadequate blood flow to organs, which can cause organ failure. Maintaining adequate blood pressure is not possible in hypovolemic shock, as the body's ability to pump blood is compromised.","482":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Maybe I'm in the US and want to buy tomatoes from you and you want to buy a hard drive from me.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"It's determined by international trade.\"\n\nThe other sentences in the answer are correct in terms of international trade principles.","483":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Gold tarnishes easily.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The correct formula for resistance is: Resistance = rho (material resistivity)  *  L (length of wire)  \/  A (area of cross section of wire)\n- The unit of resistivity is indeed Ohm meters (\u03a9m), not Ohm meters (\u03a9m).\n- The correct unit for resistivity is actually Ohm meters (\u03a9m), not Ohm meters (\u03a9m).\n- Gold is a good conductor, not a poor conductor.\n- The statement that gold tarnishes easily is incorrect; gold does not tarnish easily.","484":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"They're just big piles of dirt.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"They're built using large amounts of dirt and other materials.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the process of creating a man-made island typically involves the construction of a foundation, the placement of the island's structure, and the filling in of the surrounding area with soil and other materials. The dirt and other materials used to build the island can vary depending on the specific design and materials used, but they are not simply \"piles of dirt.\"","485":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"When you look at the small differences between four or five you can begin track backwards which was the oldest in the banching tree of similarities and differences.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"When you look at the small differences between four or five you can begin tracing backwards which was the oldest in the branching tree of similarities and differences.\"","486":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Besides this, two big hydroelectric power plants, one American and one Canadian, divert water away from the falls to generate electricity.\"\n\nThis sentence contains an incorrect statement about hydroelectric power plants diverting water from the falls.","487":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"However melatonin is kinda hard to make, and if it isn't used fairly quickly it falls apart, so if you can resist the urge to sleep for long enough, your body runs out of melatonin and can make any more until its sort of recharged your supply of it, so you just stop feeling tired.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"However melatonin is hard to make, and if it isn't used fairly quickly, it falls apart, so if you can resist the urge to sleep for long enough, your body runs out of melatonin and can't make any more until it's recharged.\"\n\nThe word \"sort of\" is the incorrect word, as the sentence should be \"so you just stop feeling tired.\"","488":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Lactic acid, CO2, adenosine (cleaving ATP into ADP yields adenine, which stimulates local vasodilation)\"\n\nThe correct process is that lactic acid (lactate) is actually a product of anaerobic glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose without oxygen, not a product of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production. Adenosine is actually a product of ATP breakdown, not ADP.","489":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's not being used because in order to work, the craft needs to be very large.\"\n\nThis sentence implies that a spacecraft would need to be enormous to create artificial gravity, which is not the case. The correct answer would be that artificial gravity can be created through rotation, as stated in the original answer, without the need for a large spacecraft.","490":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"With these cells damaged the acid within the stomach heals the tissue that's now unprotected.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"With these cells damaged the tissue heals the stomach.\"","491":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Therefore you could technically say that you're exercising your jaw a lot more than three times a day.\"","492":"Factually incorrect sentence: \"If you treat nitrogen as an ideal gas down to the transition temperature, the lowest speed will be less than 180 m\/s, less than half as fast as at normal temperatures.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement that sound moves faster at lower temperatures is correct, but it's not entirely accurate to say that sound moves \"less fast\" at lower temperatures. The speed of sound is actually independent of temperature.\n- The statement that the lowest speed of sound will be \"less than half as fast as at normal temperatures\" is incorrect. The speed of sound is constant at a given temperature, it doesn't change with temperature.","493":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If it's a digital camera, as others here have already noted this will be thermal noise from the CCD or CMOS chip, and from the amplifier and the analog-digital-converter units after it.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because digital cameras, by definition, do not have an analog-digital converter, which is a device that converts analog signals into digital signals.","494":"The factually wrong sentence is: \nEven in the case of quantum gases (Bose or Fermi), the equilibrium distribution function for an ideal gas is a continuous function.\n\nCorrected Answer: \nThe Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes a classical ideal gas at equilibrium. The energies of a classical ideal gas are quantized.","495":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Computers look at the star\/laser light and how it distorts and actuators in mirrors move in real-time to oppose the distortion and remove the twinkle from the light.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"Computers look at the star\/laser light and how it distorts and actuators in mirrors move to remove the twinkle from the light.\"\n\nThe factually correct sentence would be: \"Computers look at the star\/laser light and how it distorts to remove the twinkle from the light.\"","496":"Factually correct sentence: The Earth, on the other hand, still has a strong magnetic field from our core, which protects us and our atmosphere from the wrath of the Sun.\n\nCorrected answer: The Earth, on the other hand, still has a strong magnetic field from our core, which protects us and our atmosphere from the wrath of the Sun.\n\nThe factually wrong sentence is: \"This allows more charged particles (solar wind) to enter the atmosphere and strip it away.\"","497":"Factually incorrect sentence: \"Light belongs to a class of particles that do not bounce or recoil off one another, they simply pass right through each other.\"\n\nCorrected sentence: \"Light does not bounce or recoil off one another, they simply pass right through each other.\"\n\nThe factually incorrect sentence is the last part of the answer, which claims that \"they simply pass right through each other.\" This is incorrect because light, like all waves, does indeed bounce or recoil off other waves, but in the context of light, it refers to the fact that light particles, called photons, do not interact with each other in a bouncy or recoiling manner.","498":"The factually incorrect sentence is:\n\n\"Most of the different breeds of dogs have not been intentionally crafted by human breeders over hundreds or thousands of years.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because many dog breeds have been developed over thousands of years through selective breeding by humans for various purposes such as hunting, herding, guarding, and companionship.","499":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Apparently this is a trait of only certain kind of hermaphrodite organisms (e.g. snails are hermaphrodite but need another individual to copulate).\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Apparently this is a trait of certain kind of hermaphrodite organisms (e.g. snails are hermaphrodite).\"\n\nThe reason is that the original sentence incorrectly states that snails are hermaphrodite, which is not true. Snails are actually hermaphrodites, meaning they have both male and female reproductive organs, but they still need to mate with another snail to reproduce.","500":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Spacetime tells matter how to curve.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the correct sentence should be:\n\n\"Spacetime tells matter how to move.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the phrase \"how to curve\" is incorrect because it implies a physical object is being curved by spacetime, which is not the case in general relativity. The correct phrase is \"how to move\" because spacetime is a fabric that allows objects to move, but it doesn't actually \"curve\" in the way a physical object would.","501":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"the collective energy of which is just under that of an indigo photon.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"the collective energy of which is just equal to that of an indigo photon.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- The frequency of a photon is determined by its energy, not its color.\n- The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, not its color.\n- The re-emitted photon will be the same frequency as the absorbed one.\n- The direction of the re-emitted photon is determined by the direction of the incident photon, not by its color.\n- Ionizing the atom by ejecting an electron does not change the frequency of the photon, it changes its energy state, but it does not change its color.","502":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"but a smaller area of binocular vision.\"\n\nCorrected answer: No.","503":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It's somewhat of a budgetary question.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because it implies that the erosion of Mt. Rushmore is a budgetary issue, which is not a valid reason for the erosion.","504":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"no matter how hot it gets.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that a star that is hotter than a few thousand degrees will not emit any visible radiation, which contradicts the fact that stars emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light, regardless of their temperature.","505":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"Stuffing a sufficient amount of mass into any given space will not create a black hole.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it suggests that it's impossible to create a black hole by adding mass to any space, which contradicts the widely accepted understanding of black hole formation.","506":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"Radiation from the sun repairs the DNA in skin cells (tanning is actually a sign your skin is healthy)\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because tanning is actually a sign of skin damage, not a healthy sign.","507":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"It has to be above 10^-31 meters (times its charge)\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the correct unit for electric dipole moment is actually the Coulomb, not meters, and the charge is the elementary charge, not times the charge. The correct unit for electric dipole moment is Coulomb-meters (C\u00b7m).","508":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"when you're a kid, you are running around releasing all sorts of adrenaline, which will make you more tired later when it wears off.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\"when you're a kid, you are running around releasing all sorts of adrenaline, which can make you more energetic and alert later when it wears off.\"\n\nExplanation: The original sentence is incorrect because it states that adrenaline causes fatigue, which is not accurate. The hormone adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) actually increases energy and alertness, making you feel more energetic and alert.","509":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"It is easy to get a control group that has 0 radiation exposure to test the exact effects of such low levels of exposure.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that it is impossible to control for the effect of background radiation on cancer rates, which is not true. In fact, researchers can use control groups with varying levels of background radiation to study the effects of radiation on cancer rates.","510":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"They are larger and more visble in fruit trees such as Apple and Cherry, which have prominent horizontal lenticles up the trunk.\"\n\nThe correct answer should be: \"They are larger and more visible in trees such as Apple and Cherry, which have prominent horizontal lenticles up the trunk.\"\n\nThe reason for the error is that the sentence implies that lenticles are visible in trees, which is not the case. Lenticles are actually small protrusions or structures that are embedded in plant stems, and they are typically not visible from the outside.","511":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"They increase in size.\"\n\nThis is incorrect because the expansion of the material in the metal ring would actually cause it to increase in diameter, not decrease. The inner diameter would increase, not decrease, as the ring expands outward.","512":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"When you have two stars, you just get two forces, you subtract them to get the result, and the tail would fly in that direction with that push.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n- The statement about the force acting on the comet's dust is correct, as the force of solar winds is indeed acting on the comet's dust.\n- The statement about the direction of the force is correct, as the force of solar winds acts in one direction.\n- The statement about the comet's dust growing weaker with distance is also correct, as the force of solar winds decreases with distance.\n- The statement about the comet's tail flying in the direction of the two stars is incorrect, as the force of the two stars would actually cancel out, resulting in no net force, and therefore no tail.","513":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"the balloons seem to lose bouncy\"","514":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"It's still used though mostly because of tradition\/convention.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"It's still used though mostly because of tradition.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that, although the measurement of parsec is not as commonly used as lightyear or petameter, it has its own set of applications and is still widely used in astronomy, particularly in the field of astrophysics and cosmology, where it is used to measure distances to stars and other celestial objects.","515":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"They're all over you, living in symbiosis, and in fact being part of your first line of defense against hostile bacteria and viruses.\"","516":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"I work on the radar version.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"We work on the radar version.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe question is asking about the factually wrong sentence in the given answer. The correct sentence \"I work on the radar version\" is not accurate, as the speaker is actually working on the automotive version. The correct answer should be \"We work on the automotive version.\"","517":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"If this simplifies the matters at all, assume we're just dealing with the visible light spectrum and the physical size of the cyborg-eye is similar to that of the human eye.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the cyborg-eye would likely be significantly larger than the human eye, and the visible light spectrum would not be a factor in determining its physical limits of sight.","518":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"air-sea boundary layer becomes a slurry of air mixed with such thick driving white-foam sea spray that the exact division point between air and water becomes almost impossible to define.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be:\n\n\"air-sea boundary layer becomes a slurry of air mixed with such thick driving white foam sea spray that the exact division point between air and water becomes almost impossible to define.\"\n\nThe word \"driving\" is the factually wrong word used instead of \"drifting\".","519":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"You can solve explicitly the quantum harmonic oscillator.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"You can solve explicitly the quantum harmonic oscillator in the classical limit.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe original sentence implies that the quantum harmonic oscillator can be solved explicitly in the classical limit, which is incorrect. The quantum harmonic oscillator is a quantum mechanical system, and its solutions are typically expressed in terms of the wave functions of quantum mechanics, not in the classical limit. The classical limit is a different limit where the classical equations of motion reduce to the classical equations of motion, which is not applicable to the quantum harmonic oscillator.","520":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"If the boat is stationary with respect to the current, no forces would act on the boat and it would not move.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThis sentence is factually incorrect because, in reality, the forces acting on a stationary object (in this case, a boat) due to the water current can still cause it to move. The force of the current can push or pull the boat in a certain direction, even if the boat is stationary with respect to the current.\n\nThe correct answer should be:\n\n\"If the boat is moving with respect to the current, no forces would act on the boat and it would not move.\"","521":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"Technically, the thing you plug into the phone is not a charger.\"\n\nCorrected sentence:\n\n\"Technically, the phone is a 5 volt constant voltage (CV) power supply.\"","522":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"It's essentially Priming the tract to get ready fo food.\"\n\nThe correct sentence should be: \"It's essentially priming the tract to get ready to digest food.\"\n\nThe word \"fo\" should be replaced with \"to\" to make the sentence grammatically correct and factual.","523":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"A black hole does not evaporate through Hawking radiation until its mass starts to near the Planck mass.\"\n\nCorrected sentence: A black hole does not evaporate through Hawking radiation until its mass starts to near the Planck mass.\n\nReason: According to the theory of Hawking radiation, black holes do evaporate through Hawking radiation, which is a quantum process that occurs when a black hole loses energy due to quantum effects. This process is more likely to occur when the black hole has a mass near the Planck mass, as the energy released by the Hawking radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the black hole's mass.","524":"The factually wrong sentence is: \"There is a distinction between Hot and Cold Dark Matter (CDM) based on whether the particles involved are traveling at relativistic or non-relativistic speeds.\"\n\nAnalysis: \n- The statement about neutrinos being Hot or Cold Dark Matter (CDM) is incorrect. \n- The distinction between CDM and HDM is actually based on the nature of dark matter particles, not their speed.","525":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\n\"The increase in Carbon dioxide could over time allow for some species of plants to survive on the surface of Mars.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because it implies that plants can survive on Mars due to increased CO2 levels, which is not supported by scientific evidence. While it is true that some microorganisms can survive in extremely low-CO2 environments on Earth, there is no evidence that these organisms can survive on the Martian surface without any CO2 at all.","526":"The factually wrong sentence is:\n\"This was after the net was added.\"\n\nThis sentence is incorrect because the Golden Gate Bridge Study did not add a net to the bridge to prevent people from jumping off. The study actually followed people who had jumped from the bridge after it was closed to prevent suicides, not added a net to prevent them from jumping."}}
