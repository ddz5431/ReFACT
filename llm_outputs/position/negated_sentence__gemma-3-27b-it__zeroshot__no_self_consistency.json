particles and microorganisms and the production is decreased when you're ill).","18":"Malaria resistance is not a great example of an adaptation to a biotic factor; altitude adaptation (Tibet, Andes, etc) is not a great example of adaptation to an abiotic factor.","19":"The populations have not made dozens of spontaneous adaptations to their environment, including the ability to eat citric acid.","20":"Gravity on earth directly influences subatomic processes in the sense that the potential energy of molecular structures is changed, or gravity directly interacts with atoms.","21":"Static

the book.","34":"The ultimate function of this reflex is to increase the amount of surface area on the nipple that is exposed to the cold.","35":"Current projections suggest that another such convergence will not occur for at least 250 million years in our future; that putative future landmass has been definitively named Pangea Ultima, Pangaea Proxima, Neopangaea, or Pangaea II.","36":"In other words squinting does not act like glasses by correcting refractory errors, someone who squints should not be assessed to see if optics will helps their vision.","37":"This slowly cools the

When those bonds are broken and new, more stable bonds are formed, the difference in energy between the reactants (explosive) and the products (e.g., H2O, CO2, N2) is released as heat and kinetic energy \u2013 manifesting as an explosion.

The answer correctly states that cranes aren\u2019t balanced on a single point, and that the center of mass remains between the supports even without a load. However, the statement \u201cWith maximal load the center of mass is closer to the 'front' of the crane but still between the supports\u201d is factually incorrect. \n\nWith maximal load, the center of mass shifts *towards* the load (which is typically at the end of the boom, effectively the \"back\" of the crane relative to the counterweights and cab), not the front. The counterweight is positioned to counteract the torque created by the load, meaning the center of mass needs to be on the opposite side of the pivot point (the crane's base) from the load.  While it *remains* between the supports (that part is true), its position relative to the front of the crane is reversed when a load is present.\n\n\n\n","178":"This greatly increases the energy of the photon, up to even hundreds of MeV to GeV.\n\n\n\n","179":"This is not a method to evaluate board states.\n","180":"The photon is not a change in the electrical (and magnetic) field and the electron is not a charged particle that responds to it.\n\n\n\n","181":"Individuals with excess cortisol have been shown to have larger hippocampi, suggesting that certain cells called pyramidal cells in the hippocampus likely grow due to cortisol activity.","182":"No heat is leaving the car until the sun goes down.\n","183":"Simple answer: we know for sure, because we can go into the minds or experience the same experience the animals would.\n\n\n\n","184":"However when there is a perfect surface the solution will be supersaturated.","185":"However, for example we filmed a live giant squid before 2004, and the first pictures of a live one in its natural habitat were taken before 2004.\n","186":"The electrons in this conduction band are typically unable to absorb energy from all photons of the visible spectrum, so they pass through the metal.\n\n\n\n","187":"For covalent molecules, (excluding network solids) I'd suspect something on the order of 1500K in the absence of oxygen.\n\n\n\n","188":"It's highly unlikely there would be any defects, as the two people breeding would definitely carry genes which would lead to defects.\n\n\n\n","189":"finally the increase of the stress hormone cortisol has an effect in \"priming\" the brain to be hyper-aware of the surroundings, thus increasing reaction time when a stimulus does occur.\n\n\n\n","190":"The other scientist (Maybe Richard Feynman, it sounds clever enough for him) said something to the effect of  \"Don't worry about it, if it does ignite the atmosphere, no one will blame you.\"\n\n\n\n","191":"It relies on very common and inexpensive radioisotopes.","192":"Enamel is completely opaque.\n\n\n\n","193":"I can't speak to dogs or other non-humans, but in humans caucasians have the smallest jaws and blacks have the largest, however, all races do not have the same number of teeth.","194":"S wave velocity at the surface is going to be something like 2-3 km per second depending on a whole range of stuff.\n","195":"A green filter blocks red light, and the plastic boards reflect mostly red light, whereas the copper reflects a wider spectrum of colors and so appears a lot brighter.\n\n\n\n","196":"If those reactions produce a detectable odor, then the object is losing mass.\n\n\n\n","197":"In times of cold, the blood flow (and the other fingers, ie mittens > gloves) is what causes the fingers to freeze.\n\n\n\n","198":"It's more commonly known as \"visual purple\" because it is the lack of this protein that causes the dark ghost images seen after looking at a bright object.","199":"Swimming underwater is faster than swimming on the surface - FINA actually restricts the distance a swimmer may be submerged for during a race because of this.\n\n\n\n","200":"And that cannot be statistically verified.\n","201":"When you stand up and see stars, it's because your body responds too quickly to the need for vasoconstriction, causing your blood pressure to rise and flooding your brain with too much blood\/oxygen.\n\n\n\n","202":"In the laboratory, boiling is not a routine way by which we reduce oxygen (O2) in water-based solutions.","203":"Pneumonia, secondary to dysphagia, is how most with Alzheimer's end up dying.","204":"This just introduces a perturbation to the Hamiltonian which is a dipole coupling between different l (ell) levels, coupling l to l+1 and l-1.\n","205":"So in order to excite a nucleus, a photon usually needs to be a low-energy radio wave.","206":"This is a major concern for ag crops, since there are wild populations of, say, soybeans in the midwest.\n\n\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe statement that there are wild populations of soybeans in the Midwest is factually incorrect.

Modern ICs, even at 14nm, have far more than 13 layers \u2013 hundreds are common. These layers include metal interconnects, insulators, and active device layers.

However, the statement that there are practical ways to *fully* simulate Mars' gravity and atmosphere for a full-scale flight test is incorrect. While aspects can be simulated (like reduced gravity with suspension systems, or atmospheric density with wind tunnels), a complete, accurate replication allowing for a true flight test of the entire system is not practically achievable on Earth.

Animal fats typically melt at much lower temperatures, generally between 32-49\u00b0C (90-120\u00b0F) depending on the specific fat composition.

However, the statement that it is \u201cnot inheritable\u201d is factually incorrect. Cytoplasmic genes *are* inherited, albeit not through the nuclear genome.

While inland lakes offer some protection, artificial islands are still susceptible to erosion, subsidence (sinking), and destabilization over time. Factors like wave action (even in lakes), changing water levels, and the composition of the fill material all contribute to eventual degradation. Centuries is an unrealistic expectation for most artificial islands, even in inland lakes. \n\nThe other sentences are generally accurate: islands *are* essentially piles of dirt\/fill, and erosion\/removal processes *are* slow, contributing to their persistence.

However, this re-emission isn't typically at the *same* frequency (and therefore energy).\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the identified sentence is incorrect:\n\n*   **Energy Levels & Fluorescence\/Phosphorescence:** Molecules don't simply re-emit photons at the exact same energy. Energy is lost due to vibrational and rotational energy changes within the molecule. This means the re-emitted photon will have *lower* energy, and therefore a *lower* frequency (and longer wavelength \u2013 shifting towards redder colors). This is the principle behind fluorescence and phosphorescence.\n\n*   **Tomato Pigments:** Tomatoes contain pigments that absorb blue\/indigo light. They then re-emit photons at longer wavelengths, which we perceive as red or other colors. This is why tomatoes appear red \u2013 they are re-emitting the wavelengths they *don't* absorb.\n\nThe other sentences are reasonable within the context of the question:\n\n*   \"The direction it comes out will be completely random.\" - This is typical of photon emission.\n*   \u201cIf it ionises the atom by ejecting an electron then there is an emitted photon, so more indigo in the colour.\u201d- While ionization is possible, it doesn't necessarily mean there's *more* indigo; it\u2019s more complex and depends on the specific ionization event and resulting emissions. However, this sentence isn\u2019t demonstrably *wrong*, just less precise.\n\n\n\n","502":"Pupil dilation does not increase the amount of light hitting the retina, but it doesn't increase field of vision, magnification, etc.\n","503":"Granite from the red pyramid in Egypt has crumbled, and it is less than 4500 years old.\n\n\n\n","504":"This means that any object hotter than a few thousand degrees will emit radiation in the visible spectrum, no matter how hot it gets.\n\n\n\n","505":"Stuffing a sufficient amount of mass into any given space will not create a black hole.","506":"Radiation from the sun repairs the DNA in skin cells (tanning is actually a sign your skin is healthy).","507":"It has to be above 10^-31 meters (times its charge).\n","508":"Being outside in the sunshine (or around a lot of light) causes your brain to release melatonin.","509":"It is easy to get a control group that has 0 radiation exposure to test the exact effects of such low levels of exposure.","510":"They are larger and more visble in fruit trees such as Apple and Cherry, which have prominent horizontal lenticles up the trunk.\n\n\n\n","511":"The bearing is heated, contracting it, then it can be placed on a shaft that is larger than the inner diameter of the bearing.\n\n\n\n","512":"having two star would *not* cause there to be two tails.\n\n\n\n","513":"It's the same reason a helium balloon in your car gets pushed *forward* when you accelerate and backwards when you brake.\n\n\n\n","514":"It's not particularly useful for astronomers, who can measure an angle and instantly know for far something is.\n\n\n\n","515":"If you actually did manage to get rid of them, you'd be perfectly healthy.\n\n\n\n","516":"If you randomly hop between them, the chances that another sensor will happen to intersect for, say, 5 consecutive transmission periods becomes large.\n","517":"\u03b8 = 1.22 * 400 \/ 7000000 = 0.0001394 radians = 28.76 arcseconds.","518":"This hurricane boundary layer is often described in oceanography textbooks as \"too thick to breathe and too thin to swim in.\"\n\n\n\n","519":"There is an upper bound on the energy and there is a finite number of discrete energy levels.\n","520":"However, real life currents are always smooth, and their energy is constant with depth and location.","521":"When the power supply is plugged in to AC without a phone, it still puts out a constant 5 volts.\n\n\n\n","522":"Muscle contractions cease and the secretion of mucous and other digestive fluids stops.\n\n\n\n","523":"Black holes can only have masses much greater than the Planck mass.\n\n\n\n","524":"However, based on observations of structure formation in the early universe, we now know that most dark matter is HDM, and not CDM.\n\n\n\n","525":"Once there Oxygen would go through the Ozone-oxygen cycle eventually turning into Ozone while carbon would just help thicken the atmosphere increasing Atmospheric pressure on the surface.\n\n\n\n","526":"This important study began to help scientists understand that suicide more often than not the result of impulsivity and situational stress rather than chronic depression or mental illness.\n\n\n\n"}}
