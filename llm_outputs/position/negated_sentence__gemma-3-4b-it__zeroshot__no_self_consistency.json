even if space is not expanding.","8":"It had the (seemingly unusual) property that having a region of space with no Higgs field present takes less energy than it does to have the Higgs field take on a non-zero value.","9":"The laminations encourage the flow of current in that direction and contribute to the formation of eddy currents which would lead to efficiency and cool the motor.","10":"Spiders

bronchi are few respiratory epithelii which transport secretion of your bronchi away from your mouth where you swallow it or cough (your bronchi do not produce this mucus to get rid of foreign particles and microorganisms and the production is decreased when you're ill).","18":"Malaria resistance is not a great example of an adaptation to a biotic factor; altitude adaptation (Tibet, Andes, etc) is not a great example of adaptation to an abiotic factor.","19":"The populations have not made dozens of spontaneous adaptations to their environment, including the ability to eat citric acid.","20":"Gravity on earth directly influences subatomic processes in the sense that the potential energy of molecular structures is changed, or gravity directly interacts with atoms.","21":"Static charges accumulate less easily in dry air and the air on board a flying plane has a considerably higher humidity than what you would normally see on the ground.","22":"However, this is the case for the interface between rubber and asphalt, where a fat tire will not indeed give you greater friction.","23":"Scientists are currently not working with \"metamaterials\" which are usually composed of

the book.","34":"The ultimate function of this reflex is to increase the amount of surface area on the nipple that is exposed to the cold.","35":"Current projections suggest that another such convergence will not occur for at least 250 million years in our future; that putative future landmass has been definitively named Pangea Ultima, Pangaea Proxima, Neopangaea, or Pangaea II.","36":"In other words squinting does not act like glasses by correcting refractory errors, someone who squints should not be assessed to see if optics will helps their vision.","37":"This slowly cools the wiring, solidifying insulation, eliminating shorts, increasing the resistance and further decreasing the current, until all wiring remains intact.","38":"When there's cold food in the fridge already, it hinders the cooling of new warm food, and allows a large amount of warm air to enter, so the motor cycles more often.","39":"Skin cancer is (according to my undergrad education) never caused by UV
