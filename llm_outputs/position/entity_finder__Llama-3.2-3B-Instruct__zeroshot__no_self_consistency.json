Spectra Shield - This is actually a brand name for a type of fabric used in some body armor, not a general term for all bulletproof fabrics.\n\n2. Fragmenting bullet - While it's true that fragmenting bullets are designed to break apart upon impact, they are typically made of metal, not lead. Fragmenting bullets are designed to break apart and spread their kinetic energy over a larger area, making them more effective at penetrating soft materials like body armor. Lead is actually used in traditional bullets, but not fragmenting bullets.\n\n3. Lead knife - This is not a real type of knife. Lead is a soft, malleable metal often used in bullets and other applications, but it's not typically used to make knives. Steel is a more common material for making knives.","6":"Here are the factually wrong entities:\n\n1. Pangea\n2. OP (presumably referring to the original poster, but it's unclear what OP stands for)\n3. Desert","7":"After analyzing the answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n* \"faraway star\" - The answer doesn't specify which star, and it's not clear what \"faraway\" means in this context. However, it's likely referring to a specific star in the sky. A more accurate answer would specify the star being observed.\n\n* \"far\" - The answer uses the word \"far\" to describe the distance between the telescopes and the star. However, in astronomy, it's more accurate to use specific units of distance, such as light-years or parsecs, to describe the distance between celestial objects.\n\n* \"small point in the sky\" - This statement is misleading because it implies that the star is a small object in the sky, whereas in reality, stars are massive balls of hot, glowing gas. A more accurate description would be that the star appears as a point of light in the sky due to its vast distance from Earth.\n\n* \"larger than earth\" - This statement is factually incorrect. Stars are typically hundreds of times larger than the Earth in terms of diameter.\n\n* \"uncertainty\" - The answer mentions \"within some uncertainty,\" which is vague and doesn't provide a clear understanding of what that uncertainty refers to.\n\n* \"angular resolution of telescopes\" - This is a factual statement, but it's not entirely clear what the answer is trying to convey. The angular resolution of telescopes is a measure of their ability to distinguish between two closely spaced objects, but the answer doesn't explain how this relates to the position of the telescopes.","8":"After analyzing the answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n* The mirror's face being perpendicular to the ground is not necessarily true. A mirror's surface can be any angle, and it would still work as a mirror. The angle of incidence and reflection is not a requirement for a mirror to function.\n* The mirror will not move in the opposite direction due to the reflection. The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum before the reflection is equal to the total momentum after the reflection. Since the mirror is initially at rest, it will remain at rest after the reflection.\n* The reflected light will not appear redder than the incident light due to blueshift. Blueshift is a phenomenon that occurs when an object is moving away from an observer, causing the light emitted by the object to shift towards the blue end of the spectrum. In this scenario, the mirror is not moving relative to the light source (the flashlight), so there is no blueshift effect.\n* All energy from the light going into the mirror's motion is not accurate. The energy from the light will be reflected back as light, not absorbed by the mirror. The mirror is an inelastic reflector, meaning it will not absorb any energy from the light, but will instead reflect it back.\n\nCorrected entities should be: \n* \n* \n* \n*","9":"After analyzing the answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n* O- \n\nThe correct term should be \"O+\" or \"O negative\" instead of \"O-\".

Alcohol Dehydrogenase - This is actually an enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the liver, not a trait that has evolved in humans due to environmental factors.\n\n2. Lactase - Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk, and it is a trait that has evolved in some populations of humans due to the consumption of dairy products, but it is not a trait that \"never 'turns off'\". In fact, lactase persistence is a trait that is more common in people of European descent.\n\n3. Melanin loss after the agricultural revolution - Melanin loss is not a trait that occurred after the agricultural revolution. Melanin loss is actually a trait that is more common in people of European descent, and it is thought to have evolved due to reduced UV radiation in temperate regions, not specifically due to the agricultural revolution.\n\n4. Malaria resistance - While there are genetic adaptations to malaria, the specific example of \"malaria resistance\" as a trait is not clearly defined in the answer. However, it is true that some populations have developed genetic adaptations to malaria.\n\n5. Altitude adaptation (Himalayas, Andes, etc) - While it is true that some populations have adapted to high altitudes, the specific mention of the Himalayas and Andes as examples is not accurate. The Andes mountain range is not typically associated with altitude adaptation, and the Himalayas are not a single, monolithic example of altitude adaptation.","15":"Here are the factually wrong entities:\n\n* mites (should be \"insects\" or more specifically, \"insects like flies, beetles, or other small arthropods\")\n* small insects (should be \"small insects like flies, beetles, or other small arthropods\")\n* bugs (should be \"insects\" or \"insects like flies, beetles, or other small arthropods\")","16":"Here are the factually wrong entities found in the answer:\n\n1. 10s of Kg (should be grams or kilograms)\n2. 10^25s of Kg (should be kilograms)\n3.

Dark matter is a type of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. It is thought to be composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or other exotic particles, but its exact nature is still unknown.\n\n2. \"Harry Potter\" - The concept of an invisibility cloak in the Harry Potter series is fictional. While scientists are working on developing invisibility cloaks, they are not based on the magical concept depicted in the books.\n\n3. \"The Army\" - There is no evidence to suggest that the military is actively developing an invisibility technology that can make objects or people invisible. While the military does have research and development programs focused on stealth technology, these are aimed at reducing the visibility of military equipment or vehicles, not making them completely invisible.","22":"After analyzing the answer, the factually wrong entities are:\n\n* Baltimore Chromosome \n\nThis is incorrect because the correct term is \"Philadelphia Chromosome\", not \"Baltimore Chromosome\".

The size of a small fairly high-resolution pixel - This is incorrect. A high-resolution pixel size can vary, but a common size for high-resolution displays is around 0.3-0.5 mm. The answer provided uses 0.2 mm, which is on the lower end of this range but still reasonable.\n\n2. The diameter of the Earth - This is incorrect. The actual diameter of the Earth is approximately 12,742 km.\n\n3. The distance of the Moon - This is incorrect. The actual average distance from the Earth to the Moon is about 384,400 km.\n\n4.

Tornadoes are more common in certain regions of the United States, such as the Great Plains, and are relatively rare near the equator.)\n* Tornadoes experience no influence from the Earth's rotation at all (Tornadoes are influenced by the Earth's rotation. The Coriolis effect plays a role in the formation and behavior of tornadoes.)","117":"After analyzing the answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n* The claim that \"Every electron\/proton\/neutron is slightly different to every other electron\/proton\/neutron\" is incorrect. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons, protons, and neutrons are identical particles with the same mass and charge. They are indistinguishable from one another.\n* The claim that we can tell them apart is also incorrect. Due to their identical nature, we cannot determine whether the electron\/proton\/neutron we are observing is the same one that we observed before.\n* The exact mass of an electron is given as 9.10938356 \u00d7 10^-31 kilograms, but the answer mentions the possibility of electrons having masses of 9.10938356001 \u00d7 10^-31 kilograms or 9.10938355999 \u00d7 10^-31 kilograms, which is incorrect.

However, the presence of colors in a spectrum does not directly indicate the composition of an object. While certain spectral features can be indicative of specific materials, the composition of an object is typically determined through other methods such as spectroscopy, which analyzes the distribution of light absorbed or emitted by the object.\n\n* iron cores \n\nThis entity is factually incorrect because the answer states that the size of an iron core can \"drastically alter a planet's density\". While the presence of a core can affect a planet's density, the size of the core is not the primary factor that determines the overall density of the planet. The density of a planet is primarily determined by its mass and radius, with the mass being the dominant factor.","124":"After analyzing the answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n \n1. The 4 types of brain waves mentioned (Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Gamma) are factually correct, but the information about their relationship with sleep stages is incorrect. \n\n2. The statement that the body goes from Beta to Alpha to Theta to Gamma and back in reverse order is also incorrect. The normal sleep-wake cycle typically follows a pattern of Beta (awake) -> Alpha (relaxed) -> Theta (drowsy) -> Delta (deep sleep) -> REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, and then back to Beta (awake) when waking up.\n\n3. The mention of \"Gamma waves\" being present during deep sleep is partially correct, but Gamma waves are actually more associated with high-level cognitive processing and attention, not necessarily with deep sleep. Gamma waves are typically seen during wakefulness, especially during tasks that require attention and concentration.\n\n4. The statement that the body needs to \"readjust back to Beta waves\" after an alarm clock goes off is also incorrect. When waking up, the body naturally transitions from deep sleep (Delta or REM) to a lighter stage of sleep (usually N1, N2, or N3) before becoming awake, and then to a state of full alertness (Beta).","125":"After analyzing the answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n1. universe is anisotropic \n2. the universe is homogeneous \n\nExplanation: \n- The universe is not anisotropic. Anisotropic means that it has different properties in different directions. However, the universe is known to be isotropic on large scales, meaning it appears to be the same in all directions and has the same properties in all directions.\n- The universe is not homogeneous. Homogeneous means that it has the same properties everywhere.

Surface composition by direct observation - This is also not entirely accurate. While direct observation of a planet's surface can provide information about its surface composition, it does not directly reveal the composition of the planetary core.\n\n3.

Tributary sources (in estuaries) \n\nExplanation: While estuaries are areas where freshwater from rivers meets saltwater from the ocean, they are not typically associated with tributary sources. Tributary sources usually refer to smaller streams or rivers that flow into a larger body of water, such as a lake or ocean. Estuaries are more related to the mixing of freshwater and saltwater rather than the flow of tributaries.\n\n2. Estuaries (in estuaries)","134":"To analyze the factually wrong entities in the given answer, let's break it down:\n\n1. \"Ammonia is a stronger field ligand (has more pi character)\":\n\n   - Factually wrong entity: Ammonia is not a field ligand. Field ligands are typically large, soft ligands that can donate electrons to the metal center through a lone pair of electrons. Ammonia (NH3) is a neutral ligand that acts as a Lewis base, not a field ligand.\n\n2. \"lowering the energy of the anti-bonding orbitals leading to a stronger ligand interaction than Cl^(-)\".\n\n   - Factually wrong entity: Ammonia's effect on the anti-bonding orbitals is not a well-established concept in coordination chemistry. The statement seems to be incorrect or oversimplified. Ammonia's interaction with metal ions is primarily due to its Lewis basicity, not its effect on anti-bonding orbitals.\n\n3. \"These difference are relatively small and ultimately an equilibrium is established; the extent to which the equilibrium is shifted to ammonia complexation I'm not sure\".\n\n   - Factually wrong entity: The statement is unclear and lacks specificity. While it's true that equilibria can be established in ligand substitution reactions, the phrase \"the extent to which the equilibrium is shifted to ammonia complexation\" is ambiguous and doesn't provide any clear information about the reaction.\n\nCorrected response:\nYou have to be careful with ammonia solution as you'll produce insoluble metal hydroxides. With enough ammonia though, the chloride should be substituted. Ammonia is a Lewis base, which can form a complex with copper(II) ions. The extent to which the chloride is substituted by ammonia depends on various factors, including the concentration of ammonia, pH, and the specific conditions of the reaction.","135":"After analyzing the answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n1. Jupiter and Saturn\n\nThe statement claims that Jupiter and Saturn have most of the mass of hydrogen and helium, which is not accurate. While Jupiter is a gas giant and does contain a significant amount of hydrogen and helium, it is not the case that most of the mass of these elements is found in Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n2. The inner planets\n\nThe statement claims that the inner planets lack hydrogen and helium because their gravity is unable to hold these elements, and they are blown away by cosmic radiation. This is not accurate. The inner planets, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are actually capable of retaining their atmospheres, and hydrogen and helium are present in their atmospheres, although in much smaller amounts than in the outer planets.\n\n3. Cosmic radiation\n\nThe statement mentions cosmic radiation as the reason why hydrogen and helium escape from the inner planets. While cosmic radiation can affect the solar system, it is not the primary reason why the inner planets retain their atmospheres.","136":"After analyzing the answer, the factually wrong entities are:\n\n* isostability lines \n\nExplanation: \n\n- The term \"isostability lines\" is not a recognized term in physics or chemistry. The correct term is \"isobars\" or \"isoelements\", but even then, the concept of \"isostability lines\" does not accurately describe the relationship between protons and neutrons in an atom.\n\nNote: The concept of isobars or isoelements refers to elements with the same number of protons, which is the definition of an element, not \"isostability lines\".","137":"Here are the factually wrong entities:\n\n1. \"dino\u2019s\" (should be \"dinosaurs\")\n2. \"dino's\" (should be \"dinosaurs\" - second occurrence)","138":"The factually wrong entities are:\n\n1.

The formation of a precipitate is determined by the concentration of the solute and the temperature of the solution.\n\n2. \"chemical handwarmers\" - This is factually wrong. Chemical handwarmers are actually small, portable heat packs that contain a mixture of iron and a combustible material, such as iron filings and a combustible substance like aluminum or magnesium. When the handwarmer is activated, the iron reacts with the combustible material to produce heat. This is not related to the formation of a supersaturated solution or precipitation.\n\n3. \"knick the piece\" - This is factually wrong. The process of forming a precipitate in a supersaturated solution does not involve \"knicking\" or scratching a piece of metal. Instead, the precipitate forms spontaneously when the solution is cooled or allowed to sit for a period of time.\n\n4. \"imperfect surface\" - This is factually wrong because the formation of a precipitate in a supersaturated solution is not dependent on the surface characteristics of the metal. The formation of a precipitate is determined by the concentration of the solute and the temperature of the solution.\n\n5. \"formation of huge crystals\" - This is factually wrong. While it is possible to form large crystals in a supersaturated solution, it is not a guarantee. The size of the crystals that form depends on various factors, such as the concentration of the solute, the temperature of the solution, and the presence of impurities.\n\n6. \"lots of exothermal energy\" - This is factually wrong.

In reality, when a crystal is split, the surface atoms are not necessarily in a \"dangling bonds\" state. The bonds are simply broken, but the atoms themselves are not necessarily in a high-energy state.\n* \"extra bonds with neighboring atoms\" - While it is true that the crystal can reform bonds with neighboring atoms after cleavage, this is not the primary mechanism by which the crystal structure is modified.

The core heat and pressure required for fusion to occur are not directly related to Jupiter's mass.\n\n2. 1000 solar masses: This is the Jeans mass, which is the maximum mass of a star that can be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. However, it is not the maximum size a planet can reach. The Jeans mass is a critical mass for the formation of a star, but it does not dictate the maximum size of a planet.\n\n3. Neutron star: While it is true that a planet with a mass greater than the Jeans mass would become a neutron star, the answer does not accurately describe the process. A neutron star forms when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion, leaving behind a core that has undergone nuclear fusion and has a density so high that electron degeneracy pressure is overcome by gravity, causing it to collapse into a neutron star. A planet, even with a mass greater than the Jeans mass, would not undergo a similar process.\n\n4.

Sound attenuation refers to the reduction of sound intensity with distance, whereas ISO 9613-2 provides a standard for calculating the absorption of sound by surfaces.\n\n2. Sound attenuation is actually higher in cold air, not lower. The speed of sound is lower in cold air, which means sound travels slower and is more affected by obstacles and absorption.\n\n3. Sound does not curve away or towards the ground due to a temperature gradient. While temperature gradients can affect the speed of sound, it does not cause sound to curve away or towards the ground. Sound behaves according to the laws of physics and is not affected by temperature gradients in this way.","190":"Here are the factually wrong entities:\n\n1. Ups syndrome \n2. Botany \n3.

Linear momentum is a different concept that refers to the product of an object's mass and its velocity.\n\nThe correct relationship between angular momentum and linear momentum is that they are two different physical quantities that describe different aspects of an object's motion. Angular momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to keep rotating or revolving around a central axis, while linear momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to keep moving in a straight line.\n\nThe correct way to transfer angular momentum to a macroscopic object is through the interaction of photons with the object, such as through the emission or absorption of photons by the object, or through the interaction of the object with other particles that carry angular momentum.\n\nHere is the corrected answer:\n\nAs I understand it, angular momentum of a photon is related to its spin, which is a quantum property.  How then, if the photons are not actually rotating, do they transfer angular momentum to make a macroscopic object actually rotate?","266":"Here are the factually wrong entities:\n\n1. 15.2 billion years \n2. 15.2 billion light years \n\nThese two entities are incorrect because the age of the universe is estimated to be approximately 13.8 billion years, not 15.2 billion years.

In this case, the shoulder is not the fulcrum, but rather the point from which the force is applied (the hand). The correct fulcrum would be the point where the hand is attached to the body or the point of rotation.\n\n* Lever arm: The shape of the lever arm does matter in determining the torque. In a traditional lever system, the shape of the lever arm (or the distance from the fulcrum to the point of force application) affects the torque. A longer lever arm results in a greater torque for a given force.\n\n* Position vector: While it is true that the position vector is relative to the fulcrum, the formula T = r * F assumes a constant magnitude of the force F. In reality, the force F is not always straight down toward the ground, but can be at an angle relative to the position vector r. The correct formula should take into account the component of the force parallel to the position vector.\n\nCorrected answer should consider the correct definition of torque, the role of the fulcrum, and the effect of the lever arm and the angle of the force.","291":"Here are the factually wrong entities:\n\n \n1.

The answer starts by stating that there is no correlation between density and viscosity, which is correct. Density and viscosity are related but distinct properties of a fluid.\n\n2. The example of Mercury being very dense (13.5 g\/mL) but flowing easily at room temperature is incorrect. Mercury is actually a liquid at room temperature, and its high density contributes to its high viscosity, not its ability to flow easily.\n\n3. The example of Polyethylene having a density of 0.9 g\/mL but not flowing at room temperature is incorrect. Polyethylene is a polymer that can flow at room temperature, but its viscosity can vary depending on its molecular weight and other factors.\n\n4. The example of Gasoline having a density of ~0.8 g\/mL but having very low viscosity is correct. Gasoline is a liquid with a relatively low density and low viscosity.\n\n5.

The answer implies that all bacteria in biofilms are pathogenic, which is not true. Not all bacteria in biofilms are pathogenic.\n\n3. \"the toxins or whatever that cause the disease\" - This is vague and factually incorrect. The answer implies that the toxins are produced by the bacteria in response to quorum sensing, but it does not specify what the toxins are.\n\n4. \"biofilm disruption is the method that induces virulence\" - This is factually incorrect. Biofilm disruption can actually decrease virulence, not increase it.\n\n5. \"pathways\" - The answer is too vague and does not specify what pathways are being referred to.\n\n6. \"if these pathways are blocked the bacteria would essentially think its alone\" - This is factually incorrect. Bacteria in biofilms can still communicate and respond to their environment even if their quorum sensing system is disrupted.\n\n7. \"not become virulent\" - This is factually incorrect. Disrupting quorum sensing can actually make bacteria less virulent, but it does not necessarily mean they will not become virulent at all.\n\n8. \"which would make it much more susceptible to gaining resistance\" - This is factually incorrect. Disrupting quorum sensing can actually make bacteria more resistant to certain antibiotics, not more susceptible.\n\n9. \"bacteria would continue living\" - This is factually correct, but the answer implies that the bacteria will not become virulent, which is not necessarily true.\n\n10. \"even if there were other bacteria present in sufficient concentrations\" - This is factually incorrect.

However, the Hohmann transfer orbit is actually a type of transfer orbit that is used to move between two celestial bodies, and it can indeed be used to reach the Moon. The key difference is that the Hohmann transfer orbit is typically used for interplanetary travel, not for orbiting the Moon.\n\nThe answer also mentions that the elliptic would stay the same relative to the Sun, but the Moon would keep moving along its trajectory. This is partially correct, as the Moon's orbit is indeed influenced by the Sun's gravity. However, the statement that the elliptic wouldn't be aimed at the Moon anymore and would just be a long ellipse instead of a figure-8 is incorrect. The Hohmann transfer orbit is designed to transfer the spacecraft from one orbit to another, and it can be adjusted to be aimed at the Moon.\n\nThe answer also mentions that the Apollo moon missions were put on a course like that so that if anything went wrong, they could just \"not do anything\" and the spacecraft would naturally course back towards Earth by itself, passing around the moon harmlessly. This statement is incorrect. The Apollo missions were actually put on a Hohmann transfer orbit to reach the Moon, but they did not rely on the spacecraft to \"naturally course back towards Earth\" if something went wrong. Instead, the astronauts made precise course corrections to ensure a safe re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe final statement that the astronauts would then make minor corrections so that they would proceed to reentry into Earth's atmosphere is also incorrect. The Apollo astronauts had to make precise course corrections to ensure a safe re-entry, but this was done after they had completed their mission and were on their way back to Earth.\n\nFactually wrong entities:\n\n* Hohmann transfer orbit being temporary in nature\n* The elliptic staying the same relative to the Sun\n* The elliptic not being aimed at the Moon anymore\n* The spacecraft relying on the natural course to return to Earth if something went wrong\n* The astronauts making minor corrections after completing their mission and before re-entry","369":"Here are the factually wrong entities in the answer:\n\n* cardinality\n* cardinalities\n* set\n* cardinality\n* unionset\n* union\n* strictly\n* strictly \n\nNote: \"strictly\" is used twice in the answer which is also incorrect as cardinalities can be equal.","370":"After analyzing the given answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n1.

Pigment molecules are also correct, but the statement that hydrogen ions damage the pigment molecule by binding to it is incorrect. Hydrogen peroxide works by oxidizing the pigment molecules, breaking them down, which leads to a lighter color.\n\n3.

The change in wavelength due to random direction of emission does not affect the color or frequency of the photon.\n\n3. \"excites the atom by ejecting an electron then there is no emitted photon\" - This statement is partially incorrect. When a photon is absorbed, it can excite an atom and eject an electron, but this does not mean there is no emitted photon. The emitted photon is simply the re-emitted photon that is emitted in a different direction.\n\nCorrected entities: \ngreenish\nless indigo in the colour\nexcites the atom by ejecting an electron then there is no emitted photon","433":"Here are the factually wrong entities in the answer:\n\n\n* autonomic nervous system \n* muscle tissue in the tubes that carry sperm cells up from where they are stored in the vas deferens \n* seminal vesicles \n* prostate \n* bulbourethral glands","434":"Here are the factually wrong entities in the given answer:\n\n1.

The observable universe is the part of the universe that we can see, and it is estimated to be around 93 billion light-years in diameter. The universe is still expanding, and the distance between objects increases as space itself expands. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the universe is curved back in on itself at the edge. The expansion of the universe is thought to be uniform in all directions, and the distances between objects increase linearly with distance.","440":"After analyzing the answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n1. 0.5 mm gap \n2. Standard temperature and pressure \n\nThese entities are factually wrong because:\n\n1. The gap size of 0.5 mm is too small for the voltage to ionize the air effectively. Typically, gaps of around 1-2 mm are required to create a conductive channel.\n2. The statement about standard temperature and pressure is not relevant to the specific situation of a gap in a wire. The voltage required to ionize the air is more dependent on the gap size and the properties of the air, rather than the temperature and pressure.","441":"After analyzing the answer, I found the factually wrong entities:\n\n1. \"breeze blowing parallel to the wall\" - This statement is incorrect. A breeze blowing parallel to a wall does not create a significant pressure difference, which is necessary for airflow to occur. The airflow would be minimal or nonexistent.\n\n2. \"cross-ventilation\" - This term is correct, but the context is incorrect. Cross-ventilation refers to the movement of air from one side of a room to the other through openings or windows, but it typically requires the breeze to be perpendicular to the wall, not parallel.\n\n3. \"airflow to have both an entrance and an exit\" - This statement is incorrect. In this scenario, the airflow would not have an exit, as there is no opening or window on the opposite side of the room to allow air to escape.\n\nThe correct answer should have addressed the fact that a breeze blowing parallel to a wall does not create a significant pressure difference, and therefore, opening a second window would not create appreciably better airflow.\n\nFactually wrong
