A surface which has had the majority of the rust mechanically removed (e.g. by wire brushing) can be painted on. Historically, red lead was the primer of choice for such surfaces as it reacted to form phosphates which are non-reactive, but the safety implications of lead-based coatings mean that it is not used these days.\n\nNewlines:\nChemical that reacts with Rust to \u2018seal\u2019 a surface?\nHas anyone come up with some type of sealant or protectant that can be applied directly to a rusty surface and the chemical actually reacts with rust itself to create the sealant?\n\nWrong Entities: \nChemical","20":"Here are the factually wrong entities in the answer with newlines:\n\nGeneralized peritonitis\nSeptic shock\nGastric peritonitis\nSeptic shock","21":"Here are the factually wrong entities with newlines:\n\n* Scientists are currently working with \"dark matter\" which are usually composed of metals and ceramics.\n* Scientists are making small things appear and disappear but for an invisibility cloak which is seen in Harry Potter\n* The Army are also developing some invisibility technology","22":"Here are the factually wrong entities with newlines:\n\nbcr-abl\ntyrosine kinase\nBCR\nABL\nBaltimore Chromosome\nBlaston","23":"Here are the factually wrong entities found in the given answer:\n\n- \"religion\" \n- \"coworker\"","24":"Here are the factually wrong entities with newlines:\n\n1. 2 liter\n2.

Energy (E) and momentum (p) are related but distinct concepts in physics. Energy is the capacity to do work, while momentum is the product of mass (m) and velocity (v). \n\n- But if it has momentum doesnt that mean it also has mass?\n  Factually correct: This statement is correct. Momentum is indeed related to mass, but it is not the same as mass. Momentum is a vector quantity, while mass is a scalar quantity.\n\n- If light has Energy (E) then according to Einstein it also has Momentum (E\u00b2=(mc\u00b2)\u00b2+(pc)\u00b2)\n  Factually correct: This statement is correct. The equation E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 is a relativistic equation that describes the energy-momentum relationship for objects moving at relativistic speeds.\n\n- but if it has Momentum (p) it also has mass (P=mv)\n  Factually correct: This statement is correct. The equation P = mv is a relativistic equation that describes the momentum of an object, and it is indeed related to mass.\n\n- I dont understand. How can something have momentum but no mass?\n  Factually correct: This statement is correct. Momentum is a measure of the tendency of an object to keep moving in a straight line, while mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. They are not the same thing, and momentum can be zero for objects with zero mass.\n\n- Is p=mv just outdated and a simple formula taught for its ease and can only apply to classical objects?\n  Factually correct: This statement is correct. The equation p = mv is a relativistic equation that applies to objects moving at relativistic speeds, which is typically below the speed of light. In classical physics, the equation p = mv is a more general equation that applies to all objects, regardless of their velocity.","66":"Here are the factually wrong entities with newlines:\n\nFoam: Coca-Cola vs Whiskey and Coke \nWhy is it that the foam created when pouring Coke into whiskey is larger, thicker, and lasts longer than the foam from when you normally pour a Coke?\nAnswer: There are a number of processes in foam stability and collapse - drainage of lamellae between bubbles, surface elasticity, electrostatics, and steric repulsion of surfactants...\n\nIt's a bit of a complicated question because I'm not sure what's in the whiskey (likely something acting as a surface active agent).\n\nHere's a fun fact: the pressure inside a smaller bubble is actually higher than in a larger bubble.

The universe was also very uniform and very hot. Because it was uniform, the gravitational acceleration on any point is basically zero. There were tiny fluctuations in density, but the universe was so hot that its pressure would just bounce these back before they collapsed. It was also so thick and opaque that it couldn't really radiate the temperature away from any point. It's only later that the universe cooled down enough to allow things to collapse into galaxies and stars and so on.","417":"Here are the factually wrong entities found in the given answer:\n\n- Moon colony\n- Bone density\n- Muscle atrophy\n- Vitamin D\n- Abnormally\n- Sick\n- Impediment","418":"Here are the factually wrong entities:\n\n- \"ground level\"\n- \"equator\"\n- \"at the equator\"","419":"After analyzing the answer, I found the following factually wrong entities:\n\n- Himalayas\n- Indian subcontinent\n- Asian plate\n- Southeast Asia\n- Himalaya","420":"Here are the factually wrong entities:\n\n- Higgs boson\n- Space-Time Field\n- Space-Time\n- Electromagnetic field\n- Photons\n- Gluons\n- Tau lepton\n- Top quark","421":"Here are the factually wrong entities with newlines:\n\n1. \"the two slits\" \n2. \"the top and bottom part\" \n3. \"the Laplace transform\"","422":"Factually wrong entities in the given answer are:\n\n- \"space\" (it is a physical concept, not an entity that can propagate)\n- \"comp sci major\" (a field of study, not a specific entity)\n- \"gravity\" (a fundamental force, not an entity)\n- \"space-time\" (a concept in physics, not an entity)\n- \"gravity affects all matter\" (gravity is a force, not an entity)\n- \"black hole\" (a region of spacetime with such strong gravity that not even light can escape, not an entity)\n- \"stellar blueshift\" (stellar refers to stars, not an entity)\n- \"wavelength\" (a measure of frequency, not an entity)\n- \"gravitational universal shift\" (gravitational universal shift is not a recognized concept)\n- \"out of a black hole\" (black holes are regions of spacetime, not objects that can be \"out\" of them)","423":"Here are the factually wrong entities with newlines:\n\nIn the movie Interstellar, the spaceship Endurance spins to create artificial gravity. Would this work in real life? If so, how come it's a method not being used.\n\nAnswer: Sure, it works via rotational inertia. I haven't seen the movie, but I believe they're referencing the craft in 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nIt's not being used because in order to work, the craft needs to be very large. If the radius was just say, the height of a human, it'd feel very weird to have 0 g's at your head and 1g at your feet. Nothing has been put into orbit of a sufficient scale for spacecraft rotating to create artificial gravity to be practical.\n\nThe factually wrong entities are:\n- Endurance (the spaceship in the movie Interstellar)\n- 2001: A Space Odyssey (the movie, not the year)","424":"Here are the factually wrong entities with newlines:\n\n1. jawline\n2. masseter\n3. temporalis\n4. masseters\n5. mass","425":"Here are the factually wrong entities in the given answer:\n\n- \"Woahdude\" \n- \"CCD\" \n- \"CMOS\" \n- \"CCD or CMOS chip\" \n- \"thermal noise\" \n- \"halogenides\" \n- \"dyes\" \n- \"cosmic rays\" \n- \"beta\" \n- \"gamma radiation\" \n- \"alpha radiation\"","426":"Here are the factually wrong entities in the given answer:\n\n- LO (Linear Optics) \n- LO (Linear Optics) is a real concept in physics, but in this context, it is referring to the Laser Optics, which is a type of optics that uses lasers to manipulate light.","427":"Here are the factually wrong entities with newlines:\n\n- hair producing cells\n- genes\n- cells\n- genes\n- Y chromosome","428":"Here are the factually wrong entities:\n\n- Solar Wind \n- Ozone Layer \n- Core","429":"Here are the factually wrong entities with newlines:\n\nI. \"less than 10%\" - This is incorrect.
