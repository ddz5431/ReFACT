This causes nerves to shut down in the extremities which is why you don't feel as much pain when you are cold and any pain you feel seems duller. Then when you introduce sudden heat to the area it is a huge boost in energy to these nerves that were pretty much shut down and this energy causes them to surge and reconnect with the central cortex and you experience this as pain. Also, when they are hit by the sudden heat your nerves have to preform a kind of calibration to readjust themselves to what is actually painful.\n","452":"They are areas of the sun's surface that are cooler than the rest of it.
