The heat that enables the lower pieces of the paper to react with oxygen comes from the heat produced by the upper pieces of the paper reacting with oxygen - in other words, the heat from the existing fire sets the adjacent pieces of paper on fire.\n3. The fire itself isn't a physical thing that can move.

You could catch and hand in a dead cobra for a reward. People started breeding the cobras at home to get the reward money. The government cancelled the scheme, so everyone released their farmed cobras into the wild. Cobra population increased massively.\n3) Marijuana use in prisons lead to prisoners switching to harder drugs that didn't show up in the <mask>.

Gravity on earth does not directly influence subatomic processes in the sense that the potential energy of molecular structures is changed, or gravity directly interacts with atoms.\n2. This might be different on <mask>, or near black holes, but on earth the most significant effect gravity has on a chemical reaction is generating atmospheric\/hydrostatic pressure, which could accelerate a chemical reaction by holding its educts spatially together.\n3. The distribution of molecules and\/or diffusion paths will be influenced by gravity.\n\nNote: The original answer does not have a <mask> tag, so there are no replacements for that tag.","19":"Here are the replacements for the <mask> tags:\n\n1. olfactory receptors\n2. sense of smell\n3. sense\n4. smell\n5. sense of smell\n6. sense\n7. smell\n8. sense","20":"Based on the analysis, here are the replacements for the `<mask>` tags in the answer:\n\n1. `#mask`\n2. `#masking`\n3. `#masking agent`\n4. `#paint`\n5. `#painting`\n6. `#painting surface`","21":"Based on the analysis, here are the replacements for the `<mask>` tags in the answer:\n\n1. <mask> -> <p>\n2.

The problem is that BCR-ABL is a fusion protein not normally found that is always stuck in the 'on' position, ignoring other regulatory cell signals.

Replacing <mask> with <emphatic>\n\nThe reason for replacing `<mask>` with `<color>` is that the question asks for a replacement for the tag, which implies a visual representation of the phenomenon being discussed. Using `<color>` will provide a visual representation of the radiation, whereas `<mask>` does not have a clear visual equivalent.\n\nThe reason for replacing `<mask>` with `<emphatic>` is that the question asks for a replacement for the tag, which implies a rhetorical or emphatic tone.

Assuming classical physics does not break down at 0K, the equation takes into account the gravitational constant (capitalized G), the mass of the objects in question, and the distance between them.  There is no reason gravity should not work, s'far as classical physics is concerned.\n2. At the quantum level, the behavior of matter is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, which predict that particles can exhibit wave-like behavior, and the gravitational constant (capitalized G) plays a crucial role in this phenomenon.  The force of gravity is a fundamental force of nature, and it is the only force that acts between particles, regardless of their mass or distance.\n3. In <mask>, atoms impart a force of gravity by both their presence and their motion.  Sting theory says that matter only exists based on the vibration of multiple strings - gravity being a fundamental force of 1-D loops.\n4.
