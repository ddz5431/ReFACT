Satiety, the feeling of being full or satisfied, is the result of the hormone leptin which is produced by adipose tissue following signaling from the hypothalmus. Essentially, the brain monitors a variety of factors (blood sugar, physical fullness, etc...) and moderates the levels of these hormones in the blood stream.

Thanks","answer":"If you're talking about small electronics that use low DC voltage (i.e. laptops, cell phones, tablets, etc.) the deciding factor is usually the IC's on board in the device. These chips are usually designed for a low DC voltage and will \"fry\" if the supply voltage is too high. Rather than designing chips robust enough for 120V or 220V it's much simpler to just supply a DC box with the device and use a low voltage (often 5V, 9V or 12V in North America).","tag_type":"swap","transformed_answer":"If you're talking about small electronics that use moderate AC current (i.e. laptops, cell phones, tablets, etc.) the deciding factor is usually the IC's on board in the device.

The lining of the Fallopian tubes, or oviducts, are coated with a special type of cells called *<swap>flagellated epithelium<\/swap>*.  These look like cells with a \"brush\" on top, if you will.  The cilia are powered by the cell and effectively \"sweep\" the egg from oviduct to uterus.

Some larger species also migrate in flocks, which provides some aerodynamic benefits and helps group members reinforce navigation on long journeys. <neg>Hummingbirds are targeted by many predators and generally use food sources that can be exploited by multiple individuals so they would benefit from flocking on the breeding or wintering grounds.<\/neg> The few migratory species of hummingbird all make their journeys solo (even the juveniles), mostly during the day. Because they aren't gliding they can't get the aerodynamic benefits that geese do by flying in a V, and navigation in hummingbirds is (as far as we know) hard-wired instead of learned so following the group isn't as important. \n\nTLDR: because there's nothing in it for them.
